FADE FROM BLACK
INT. DON CORLEONE'S HOME OFFICE – DAY
BONASERA
(seated in front of the
Don's desk, facing the
camera)
I believe in America. America has made my
fortune. And I raised my daughter in the
American fashion. I gave her freedom, but
I taught her never to dishonor her family.
She found a boyfriend; not an Italian. She
went to the movies with him; she stayed
out late. I didn't protest. Two months
ago, he took her for a drive, with another
boyfriend. They made her drink whiskey.
And then they tried to take advantage of
her. She resisted. She kept her honor. So
they beat her, like an animal. When I went
to the hospital, her nose was a'broken.
Her jaw was a'shutted, held together by
wire. She couldn't even weep because of
the pain. But I wept. Why did I weep? She
was the light of my life ... beautiful
girl. Now she will never be beautiful
again.
Bonasera breaks down. The Don gestures to Sonny to give Bonasera a
drink.
BONASERA
Sorry...
Bonasera, taking the drink, sips from the shot glass.
BONASERA
I-I went to the police, like a good
American. These two boys were brought to
trial. The judge sentenced them to three
years in prison ... suspended sentence.
Suspended sentence! They went free that
very day! I stood in the courtroom like a
fool. And those two bastard, they smiled
at me. Then I said to my wife, "for
justice, we must go to Don Corleone."
VITO CORLEONE
(sitting behind his desk,
petting a cat)
Why did you go to the police? Why didn't
you come to me first?
2
BONASERA
What do you want of me? Tell me anything.
But do what I beg you to do.
VITO CORLEONE
What is that?
Bonasera gets up to whisper his request into Don Corleone's ear.
VITO CORLEONE
That I cannot do.
BONASERA
I'll give you anything you ask.
VITO CORLEONE
We've known each other many years, but
this is the first time you came to me for
counsel, for help. I can't remember the
last time that you invited me to your
house for a cup of coffee, even though my
wife is godmother to your only child. But
let's be frank here: you never wanted my
friendship. And uh, you were afraid to be
in my debt.
BONASERA
I didn't want to get into trouble.
VITO CORLEONE
I understand. You found paradise in
America, had a good trade, made a good
living. The police protected you; and
there were courts of law. And you didn't
need a friend of me. But uh, now you come
to me and you say "Don Corleone give me
justice." But you don't ask with respect.
You don't offer friendship. You don't even
think to call me Godfather. Instead, you
come into my house on the day my daughter
is to be married, and you uh ask me to do
murder, for money.
BONASERA
I ask you for justice.
VITO CORLEONE
That is not justice; your daughter is
still alive.
BONASERA
Then they can suffer then, as she suffers.
(then)
How much shall I pay you?
3
VITO CORLEONE
(stands, turning his back
toward Bonasera)
Bonasera... Bonasera... What have I ever
done to make you treat me so
disrespectfully? Had you come to me in
friendship, then this scum that ruined
your daughter would be suffering this very
day. And that by chance if an honest man
such as yourself should make enemies, then
they would become my enemies. And then
they would fear you.
BONASERA
Be my friend...
(after bowing and the Don
shrugs)
Godfather?
VITO CORLEONE
(after Bonasera kisses his
hand)
Good.
(then)
Some day, and that day may never come,
I'll call upon you to do a service for me.
But uh, until that day accept this justice
as a gift on my daughter's wedding day.
BONASERA
(as he leaves the room)
Grazie, Godfather.
VITO CORLEONE
Prego.
(to Tom Hagen, after
Bonasera leaves the room)
Ah, give this to ah, Clemenza. I want
reliable people; people that aren't gonna
be carried away. I'm mean, we're not
murderers, despite of what this undertaker
says.

Goddamn FBI don't respect nothing jazz

Well now that the war is over, this boy,
Enzo...they want to repatriate him back to

All right.

Luca sits, rehearsing his lines.
LUCA BRASI

Don Corleone, I am honored and grateful

there first child be a masculine child.
(starting over, which
continues throughout the
following dialogue)
Don...Don Corleone...
KAY
Michael, that man over there is talking to
himself. See that scary looking guy over
there?
LUCA'S VOICE
... On the wedding day of your daughter...
MICHAEL
(after glancing over at
Luca)
He's a very scary guy.
KAY
Well, who is he? What's his name?
MICHAEL
His name is Luca Brasi an' he helps my
father out sometimes.
Luca stands up, facing Mike and Kay, seemingly coming toward them.

Oh, Michael, wait a minute; he's coming
over here...
TOM
Mike!

Oh!

TOM
(into Michael's ear)
Your father's been asking for you.
(to Kay, before he leaves)
Very nice to meet you.
KAY
Nice to meet you.
(after Tom exits)
If he's your brother, why does he have a
different name?
MICHAEL
Oh, ah, that...when my brother Sonny was a
kid, he found Tom Hagen in the street. And
he had no home and so my father took him
in – and he's been with us ever since .
He's a good lawyer. Not a Sicilian, but I
think he's gonna be consiglieri.
KAY
What's that?
MICHAEL
That's um, like a counselor...an
advisor...very important to the family.
(then)
You like your lasagna?

up his rehearsed lines, he
fails to re cover)
... on the day of your daughter's wedding.
And I hope that their first child be a
masculine child. I pledge my ever-ending
loyalty.
Playing kids run into the room and then are escorted out by Tom.
LUCA BRASI
(as Luca hands Don Corleone
a cash-filled envelope)
For your daughter's bridal purse.

Sing a song.
The crowd encourages Johnny, and he gives in.
CUT TO:
MICHAEL AND KAY'S TABLE – DAY
KAY
Mike, you never told me you knew Johnny
Fontane!
MICHAEL
Sure... You wanna meet him?
KAY
Huh? Oh, well, sure!
MICHAEL
My father helped him with his career.
JOHNNY (O.S.)
For my Connie...
KAY
He did? How?
JOHNNY (O.S.)
(singing "I Have But One
Heart")
"I have but one heart..."
MICHAEL
Let's listen to the song...
PAN to the crowd cheering and screaming as Johnny sings.
JOHNNY
(singing, continues)
"... this love I bring you
I have but one heart
To share with you
I have but one dream
That I can cling to
You are the one dream..."
KAY
Oh, Michael...
13
JOHNNY
(singing, finishing the
verse)
"...I dream comes true..."
KAY
Please, Michael, tell me.
JOHNNY (O.S.)
(continues the song)
"My darling, until I saw you..."
MICHAEL
Well, when Johnny was first starting out,
he was signed to this personal service
contract; with a big band leader. And as
his career got better and better, he
wanted to g et out of it. Now, Johnny is
my father's godson. And my father went to
see this band leader, and he offered him
$10,000 to let Johnny go. But the band
leader said no. So the next day, my father
went to see him; only this time with Luca
Brasi. And within an hour, he signed a
release, for a certified check for $1,000.
KAY
How'd he do that?
MICHAEL
My father made him an offer he couldn't
refuse.
KAY
What was that?
MICHAEL
Luca Brasi held a gun to his head, and my
father assured him that either his brains
or his signature would be on the contract.
(then)
That's a true story.
(then)
That's my family, Kay. It's not me.
CUT TO:

A month ago he bought the movie rights to
this book. A bestseller and the main
character, it's a guy just like me. I
uh...I wouldn't even have to act...just be
myself. Oh, godfather, I don't know what
to do. I don't know what to do.
VITO CORLEONE
You can act like a man!
(after the Don slaps him on
the face)
What's the matter with you? Is this how
you turned out? A Hollywood...? That ah
cries like a woman?
(imitating Johnny)
What can I do?! What can I do?!
(then)
What is that nonsense? Ridiculous.
Sonny enters the room.
VITO CORLEONE
(to Johnny, after glancing
to see Sonny enter)
You spend time with your family?
JOHNNY
Sure I do.
VITO CORLEONE

Good. 'Cause a man who doesn't spend time
with his family can never be a real m an.

Come're.

You look terrible. I want you to eat. I
want you to rest a while. And in a month

It's too late, they start shooting in a
week.

VITO CORLEONE

Now you're new son-in-law; give him
something important?
VITO CORLEONE
Never. Give him a living, but never
discuss the family business with him. What
else?
TOM
Virgil Sollozzo called. Now we're gonna
have to give him a day sometime next week.
VITO CORLEONE
We'll discuss it when you come back from
California.
18
TOM
(laughing)
When am I going to California?

WOLTZ

Tom)
All right, start talking.
TOM
Uh, I was sent by a friend of Johnny
Fontane's. His friend is my client, who' d
give his undying friendship to Mr. Woltz,
if Mr. Woltz would grant us a small favor.
19
WOLTZ
Woltz is listening.
TOM
Give Johnny the part in that new war film
you're starting next week.
WOLTZ
(laughs)
And ah, what favor would ah your friend ah
grant Mr. Woltz?
TOM
You're gonna have some union problems; my
client could make then disappear. Also,
one of your top stars has just moved from
ah marijuana to heroin...
WOLTZ
Are you trying to muscle me?
TOM
Absolutely not.
WOLTZ
Now listen to me, you smooth-talking son-
of-a-bitch! Let me lay it on the line for
you and your boss, whoever he is. Johnny
Fontane will never get that movie! I don't
care how many daigo guinea WOP greaseball
gumbahs come out of the woodwork!
TOM
I'm German-Irish...
WOLTZ
Well let me tell you something my Kraut
Mick friend, I'm gonna make so much
trouble for you, you won't know what hit
you!
TOM
Mr. Woltz, I'm a lawyer, I have not
threatened you.
WOLTZ
I know almost every big lawyer in New
York, who the hell are you?
TOM
I have a special practice; I handle one
client. Now you have my number; I'll wait

This is really beautiful.
WOLTZ
Well, look at this. It used to decorate
the palace of a king.
TOM
Oh, yeah; very nice.
WOLTZ
Why didn't you say you worked for
Corleone, Tom? I thought you were just
some c heap two-bit hustler Johnny was
running in trying to bluff me.
TOM
I don't like to use his name unless it's
really necessary.
WOLTZ
How's your drink, Tom?
TOM
Fine.
WOLTZ
Hey, come on over here with me; I wanna
show you something really beautiful. You
do appreciate beauty, don't you?
(then)
There you are, $600,000 on four hooves. I
bet a Russian Czar never paid that kind of
dough for a single horse.
(toward the horse)
Khartoum. Khartoum.
(to Tom)
I'm not gonna race him, though. I'm gonna
put him out to stud.
TOM
He's beautiful.

Thanks, Tony.
TONY

WOLTZ

CUT TO:
INT. WOLTZ'HOUSE – EARLY EVENING
Woltz' dinner table.
TOM
Mr. Corleone is Johnny's godfather. To the
Italian people, that's a very religious,
sacred, close relationship.
WOLTZ
I respect that; just tell him he should
ask me anything else. But this is one
favor I can't give him.
TOM
He doesn't ask a second favor once he's
been refused the first, understood?
WOLTZ
You don't understand. Johnny Fontane never
gets that movie. That part is perfect for
him; it'll make him a big star. And I'm
gonna run him out of the business, and let
me tell you why.
(after he stands)
Johnny Fontane ruined one of Woltz
International's most valuable proteges.
For five years we had her under training.
Singing lessons; acting lessons, dancing
lessons. I spent hundreds of thousands of
dollars on her. I was gonna make her a big
star! And let me be even more frank, just
to show you that I'm not a hard-hearted
man, and it's not all dollars and cents.
She was beautiful; she was young, she was
innocent. She was the greatest piece of
ass I ever had, and I had'em all over the
world! And then Johnny Fontane comes along
with his olive-oil voice, and guinea
charm. And she runs off. She threw it all
away just to make me look ridiculous! And
(more)
22
WOLTZ (Cont’d)
a man in my position can't afford to be
made to look ridiculous ! Now you get the
hell outta here! And if that gumbah tries
any rough stuff, you tell him I ain't no
band leader! Yeah, I heard that story...
TOM
Thank you for the dinner and a very
pleasant evening. If your car could take
me to the airport; Mr. Corleone is a man
who insists on hearing bad news
immediately.
Tom nods, then exits.
CUT TO:
PAN OF EXTERIOR OF WOLTZ' ESTATE – DAWN
Music is a variation of the Title Theme, then we see the interior

CLOSEUP OF VITO CORLEONE'S FACE
He nods.
VITO CORLEONE
You're not too tired, are you, Tom?
TOM
No, no. I slept on the plane.
(as we see Sollozzo entering
the Don's office from the
street)
I have the Sollozzo notes here. Now
Sollozzo is known as 'The Turk.' He's
supposed to be very good with a knife, but
only in matters of business or some sort
of reasonable complaint. Uh, his business
is narcotics. He has fields in Turkey
where they grow the poppy. And in Sicily
he has the plants to process them into
heroin. Now he needs cash, and he needs
protection from the police, for which he
gives a piece of the action...I couldn't
find out how much. The Tattaglia family is
behind him here in New York. Now they have
to be in it for something.

Two terms. One in Italy, one here. He's

VITO CORLEONE
Santino? Whattaya think?
SONNY
There's a lot of money in that white
powder.
VITO CORLEONE
Tom?
TOM
(Sollozzo scenes still
intercut)
Well, I say yes. There's more money
potential in narcotics than anything else
we're looking at. Now if we don't get into
it, somebody else will. Maybe one of the
Five Families, maybe all of them. Now with
the money they earn, they can buy more
police and political power; then they come
after us. Now we have the unions, we have
the gambling; an' they're the best things
to have. But narcotics is a thing of the
future. An' if we don't get a piece of
that action, we risk everything we
have...I mean not now, but ah ten years
from now.
SONNY
So, what's your answer gonna be, Pop?

SOLLOZZO MEETING IN DON CORLEONE'S GENCO OFFICE – DAY
Scene includes the Don, Sollozzo, Tom, Sonny, Fredo, Clemenza, and
Tessio sitting in Room #2.
24
SOLLOZZO
Bene. Don Corleone. I need a man who has
powerful friends. I need a million dol
lars in cash. I need, Don Corleone, those
politicians that you carry in your pocket,
like so many nickels and dimes.
VITO CORLEONE
What is the interests for my family?
SOLLOZZO
Thirty percent. In the first year, your
end should be three-four-million dollars.
And then it would go up.
VITO CORLEONE
And what is the interest for the Tattaglia
Family?
SOLLOZZO
(to Tom)
My compliments.
(to Don Corleone)
I'll take care of the Tattaglia's, outta
my share.
VITO CORLEONE
So I receive thirty percent for finance
political influence, and legal protection,
that's what your telling me?
SOLLOZZO
That's right
VITO CORLEONE
Why do you come to me? Why do I deserve
this generosity?
SOLLOZZO
If you consider a million dollars in cash
just finance, te salute, Don Corleone.
VITO CORLEONE
(gets up to pour Sollozzo
another drink)
I said that I would see you because, I
heard that you're a serious man, to be
treated with respect.
(after sitting)
But uh, I must say no to you and I'll give
you my reasons. It's true, I have a lot of
friends in politics, but they wouldn't be
friendly very long if they knew my
business w as drugs instead of
(more)
25
VITO CORLEONE (Cont'd)
gambling, which they rule that as a
harmless vice. But drugs is a dirty
business.
SOLLOZZO
Don Corleone...
VITO CORLEONE
It...makes...it doesn't make any
difference to me what a man does for a
living, understand. But your business is
ah...a little dangerous.
SOLLOZZO
If you're worried about security for your
million, the Tattaglia's will guarantee
it.
SONNY
Aw, you're telling me that the Tattaglia's
guarantee our investment?
VITO CORLEONE
(to Sonny)
Wait a minute...
Clemenza and Tom look at each other, realizing Sonny's faux pas.
Sollozzo notices this.
VITO CORLEONE
(to Sollozzo)
I have a sentimental weakness for my
children, and I spoil them as you can see;
they talk when they should listen. But,
anyway, Signor Sollozzo, my no is final,
and I wish to congratulate you on your new
business, and I hope you do very well. And
good luck to you...as best as your
interests don't conflict with my
interests. Thank you.
The group begins to leave the room: Sollozzo, Clemenza, Tessio,
Fredo.
VITO CORLEONE
Santino, come're. Whattsa matter with you?
I think your brain is going soft fro m all
that comedy your playing with that young
girl. Never tell anybody outside the
family what you're thinking again!

VITO CORLEONE (Cont'd)

Go on...

(to person holding flowers)
Take it over there.

VITO CORLEONE
I'm a little worried about this Sollozzo
fella. I want you to find out what he' s

think that ah you're...you're not too

KAY
Uh-huh...
MICHAEL

MICHAEL

KAY
Michael, they're expecting us!
MICHAEL
Oh, Kay...get the phone...
KAY

MICHAEL

Kay gives Michael the phone, and he picks up the receiver and the

MICHAEL

TOM
Is there anything I can do for you?

What's in it for me?.
SOLLOZZO
(in Italian)
$50,000...to start with..
LUCA
(in Italian)
Not bad.
SOLLOZZO
(offering his hand to Luca;
in Italian)
Agreed?
Luca doesn't shake. He takes out a cigarette, which Bruno lights.
LUCA
Grazie.
Bruno grabs Luca's hand to the bar, Sollozzo rams a knife into it,
and Luca is garroted by an unidentified buttonman.
CUT TO:
EXT. CITY STREET – EARLY MORNING

SOLLOZZO
Tom! Tom Hagen! Merry Christmas!
(after Tom nods)
Heh, I'm glad I run into you; I want to
talk to you.
TOM
Well I haven't got time
SOLLOZZO
Aw, make time, consiglieri. Get in the
car.

What are you worried about? If I wanted to

(then)
Get in.

After the don gets some oranges and a green pepper, he hears
footsteps, then running. He begins to run toward the car, he
stumbles and falls onto the car. The shooters shoot about 10 shots
at him. The Don screams Uh!, falls over, the assassins run, and
the Don falls to the curb.

EXT. RADIO CITY MUSIC HALL – EVENING
Michael and Kay walking outside of Radio City Music Hall, which is

Kay just saw. Music playing is "Bells of St. Mary's".
KAY
Mike, would you like me better if I were a
nun? Like in the story, you know?
MICHAEL
(after pausing)
No.
KAY
Then would you like me better if I were
Ingrid Bergman?
MICHAEL
Now that's a thought...
KAY

MICHAEL
No, I would not like you better if you
were Ingrid Bergman.
KAY

Michael...
They walk back to a newsstand they just passed, and Michael picks
up The Daily Mirror which has the headline: "VITO CORLEONE FEARED
MURDERED". He flips the pages to reveal an inside article:
"Assassins Gun Down Underworld Chief".
MICHAEL
They don't say if he's dead or alive...
They run across the street to a phone booth to call Sonny, as
"Mystery Music" plays, an excerpt from the Title Theme.
MICHAEL

Sonny...Michael.

SONNY'S VOICE
(over the phone)
Michael, where you been?
MICHAEL
(into the phone)

We don't know yet. There's all kinds of
stories.
(after a sigh)
He was hit bad, Mikey...
(then)
Are you there?
MICHAEL
(into the phone)
Yeah, I'm here.
SONNY'S VOICE

Where you been? I was worried.
MICHAEL

Oh! Sonny!
Sonny searches for and finds his gun from a drawer.

SONNY
(to Sandra, at the door,
after hearing knocking)
Get back...go.
(to the door)
Who is it?
CLEMENZA'S VOICE
(through the door)
Open up. It's Clemenza.
SONNY
(after letting him in)
What?
CLEMENZA
(entering)
There's more news about your old man. The
word is out on the street that he's
already dead.
SONNY
Watch your mouth. What's the matter with
you?
CLEMENZA
(after being pushed up
against the wall)
Jesus Christ; take it easy...take it easy
SONNY
Where was Paulie?
CLEMENZA
Paulie was out sick. He been calling sick
all winter.
SONNY
How many times has he been sick?
CLEMENZA
Only maybe three or four times. I mean –
SONNY
3, 4 times?
CLEMENZA
I asked Freddy if he wants me to get a
different bodyguard and he said no.
SONNY
Listen, do me a favor, pick him up right
now, I don't care how sick he is. If he's
breathing, I want you to bring him to my
father's house. Now, you understand? Now.
36
CLEMENZA
Yeah. You want me to send any people over
here?
SONNY
No. No. No. Just you and him. Ga'head.
Clemenza leaves.
SONNY
(to Sandra, who's holding
the crying baby)
Look, uh... I'll be having some people
come over to the house. A couple of our
people...
Sonny's phone rings, and he picks up.
SONNY

Hello?
SOLLOZZO'S VOICE
(over the phone)
Santino Corleone?
SONNY
(into the phone, and Sandra
leaves the room with the
baby)
Yeah...
SOLLOZZO'S VOICE
(over the phone)
We have Tom Hagen. In about three hours
he'll be released with our proposition.
Sonny checks his watch, then writes the time onto the kitchen
cabinet.
SOLLOZZO'S VOICE
(over the phone, continues)
Listen to everything he has to say before
you do anything. What's done is done.
(then)
And don't lose that famous temper of
yours, uh Sonny?
SONNY
(into the phone)
No, I'll wait...
Sollozzo hangs up, then Sonny hangs up.

INT. AN ABANDONED DINER  – NIGHT
Sollozzo with kidnapped Tom Hagen.
SOLLOZZO
(drinking coffee, to Tom)
Your boss is dead. I know you're not in
the muscle-end of the family, Tom, so I
don't want you to be scared. I want you to
help the Corleone's, and I want you to
help me.
(handing Tom a drink)
Yeah, we got him outside his office just
about an hour after we picked you up.
(then)
Drink it.
(then)
So now it's up to you to make the peace
between me and Sonny.
(then)
Sonny was hot for my deal, wasn't he? And
you knew it was the right thing to do.
TOM
Sonny'll come after you with everything
he's got.
SOLLOZZO
That'll be his first reaction, sure.
That's why you gotta talk some sense into
him. The Tattaglia family is behind me
with all their people. The other New York
Families will go along with anything that
will prevent a full-scale war. Let's face
it, Tom, and all due respect, the Don,
rest in peace, was slippin'. Ten years ago
could I have gotten to him?
(then)
Well now he's dead. He's dead, Tom, and
nothing can bring him back. So you gotta
talk to Sonny, you gotta talk to the
caporegimes, that Tessio and Fat Clemenza.
(then)
It's good business, Tom.
TOM
I'll try, but even Sonny won't be able to
call off Luca Brasi.
SOLLOZZO
Yeah, well, let me worry about Luca.
(then)
You just talk to Sonny – and the other two
kids.
38
TOM
I'll to my best.
SOLLOZZO
Good. Now, you can go.
(while walking out)
I don't like violence, Tom. I'm a business
man. Blood is a big expense.
Outside, a car, sounding its horn, pulls up; Sollozzo goes to talk
to them, and returns.
SOLLOZZO
He's still alive. They hit 'em with five
shots, and he's still alive! Well that' s
bad luck for me, and bad luck for you if
you don't make that deal!
CUT TO:
MICHAEL ARRIVES AT CORLEONE COMPOUND – NIGHT
A car drop him off at the gate, and he goes inside, seeing family
and friends.
CLEMENZA
(sitting with his wife,
stands to greet Michael)
Mike, your mother's over in the hospital
with your father; looks like he's gonna
pull through, thank God.
CUT TO:
THE DON'S OFFICE – NIGHT
With Sonny, Tom, Mike, Tessio, & Clemenza.
SONNY
(b.g., to Tom)
Whattaya think?
TOM
(b.g., to Sonny)
Too much...
SONNY
(b.g., to Tom)
Huh?
CLEMENZA
(b.g., to Tessio)
... it's a lot of bad blood. Sollozzo,
Philip Tattaglia, Bruno Tattaglia;
Garbone...
39
TOM
(b.g., to Sonny)
It's too far – I think it's too
personal... The Don'll consider this
all...
MICHAEL
(to Clemenza)
You kill all those guys?
SONNY
Hey, stay out of it, Mickey; do me a
favor.
TOM
Sollozzo's the key. You get rid of him,
every falls into line. Now what about
Luca? Sollozzo thinks he's...
SONNY
Aw...I don't know if Luca sold out we're
in a lot of trouble, believe me. A lot of
trouble.
TOM
Has anyone been able to get in touch with
Luca?
CLEMENZA
Eh, I've been trying all night. He might
be shacked up.
SONNY
Hey, Mick, do me a favor.
TOM
(b.g., to Clemenza)
Luca never sleeps over with a broad – he
always goes home when he's through...
SONNY
(to Michael)
– try ringing him...
(to Tom)
Well, Tom you're consiglieri, now what do
we do if the old man dies, God for bid.
TOM
If we lose the old man we lose our
political contacts and half our strength.
The other New York Families might wind up
supporting Sollozzo just to avoid a long
destructive war. This is almost 1946,
(more)
40
TOM (Cont'd)
nobody wants bloodshed anymore. If your
father dies...
(then)
... you make the deal, Sonny.
SONNY
That's easy for you to say, Tom, he's not
your father!
TOM
I'm as much a son to him as you or Mike.
Knock on door.
SONNY
What is it?
Paulie enters.
CLEMENZA
Hey, Paulie, I thought I told you to stay
put.
PAULIE
Well, the guy at the gates say...say they
got a package.
SONNY
Yeah? Hey, Tessio, go see what it is.
PAULIE
(to Sonny, after Tessio
exits)
You want me to hang around?
SONNY
Yeah, hang around. You all right?
PAULIE
Yeah, I'm fine
SONNY
Yeah?
Paulie coughs, perhaps deliberately.
SONNY
There's some food in the icebox, you
hungry or anything?
PAULIE
Nah, it's alright...thanks...
41
SONNY
How 'bout a drink? Have a little brandy
that'll help sweat it out. Huh? Go ahead,
baby...
PAULIE
Alright, sure that might be a good idea...
SONNY
Yeah, right.
(to Clemenza, after Paulie
exits)
I want you to take care of that
sonofabitch right away. Paulie sold out
the old man, that stronz'. I don't want to
see him again. Make that first thing on
your list, understand?
CLEMENZA
Understood.
SONNY
Hey, Mickey, tomorrow get a couple of
guys, you go over to Luca's apartment;
hang around, waitin' for him to show up...
TOM
Uh maybe we shouldn't get Mike uh mixed up
in this too directly .
SONNY
Yeah, listen, uh... hang around the house
on the phone an' be a big help, huh?
(then)
Try Luca again...go'head
Tessio enters with package, which he places on Sonny's lap.
SONNY
(unwrapping the package of
Luca's bulletproof vest-
wrapped fish)
What the hell is this?
CLEMENZA
It's a Sicilian message. It means Luca
Brasi sleeps with the fishes.

You think that's funny, or what?

I love you with all-a my heart! If I don't
see you again soon, I'm a-gonna die!
(laughs)
Heh, come over here, kid, learn something.

twenty guys someday. You see, you start
out with a little bit of oil. Then you fry
some garlic. Then you throw in some
tomatoes, tomato paste, your fry it; ya
make sure it doesn't stick. You get it to
a boil; you shove in all your sausage and
your meatballs; heh?... And a little bit
o'wine. An a little bit o'sugar, and
that's my trick.
SONNY

Why don't you cut out the crap. I got more

MICHAEL
You know, Kay, there's gonna be detectives
there...people from the press...
KAY
Well, I'll ride in the cab...
MICHAEL
I don't want you to get involved...
KAY
When will I see you again?
MICHAEL
(after a long pause)
Go back to New Hampshire, and I'll call
you at your parents' house.
KAY
When will I see you again, Michael?
MICHAEL
I don't know...
Michael kisses Kay, then exits.
DISSOLVE TO:
THE HOSPITAL (10:30PM)
Michael arrives by cab. He enters the quiet hospital to find no
one at the nurse's station. He walks down the hall to check an
office, and only sees a half-finished sandwich on a desk. He runs
down the hall and up the stairs towards his father's room. He
pauses, noticing there is no guard outside the Don's door. He
walks around the corner up to Room #2 and hesitates before he
pushing the door open. His father is in the bed, and Michael
wonders if he's alive. He walks up to the Don.
NURSE
(entering the room)
What are you doing here? You're not
supposed to be here now!
MICHAEL
I'm Michael Corleone...this is my father.
(then)
There's nobody here. What happened to the
guards?
NURSE
Your father just had too many visitors.
They interfered with hospital service. The
police made them leave about ten minutes
ago.
48
As the nurse checks the Don's pulse, Michael picks up the phone.
MICHAEL
(into phone)
Ah, Get me, ah, Long Beach-4-5620,
please...
(to nurse, who was leaving
the room)
Nurse, wait a minute. Stay here.
(into phone)
Sonny, Michael. I'm at the hospital.
SONNY'S VOICE
(over the phone)
Yeah?
MICHAEL
(into the phone)
Listen I got here late. There's nobody
here.
SONNY'S VOICE
(over the phone)
What? Nobody?
MICHAEL
(into the phone)
Nobody... no no no Tessio's men, no
detectives, nobody. Papa's all alone.
SONNY'S VOICE
(over the phone)
Don't panic we'll send somebody...
MICHAEL
(loudly)
I won't panic!
He hangs up the phone.
NURSE
I'm sorry; but you will have to leave.
MICHAEL
(as he checks to see if the
bed would fit through the
doorway)
Uhh... You and I are gonna moo...move my
father to another room. Now can you
disconnect those tubes so we can move the
bed out?
NURSE
That's out of the question!
49
MICHAEL
You know my father? Men are coming here to
kill him. You understand? Now help me,
please.
Michael and nurse roll the Don's bed to another room. We hear a
door close, then footsteps are heard coming up the stairs as
Michael peers from the doorway. A man holding flowers seems to be
looking for a room.
MICHAEL
(coming out of hiding)
Who are you?
ENZO
I am Enzo, the baker. Do you remember me?
MICHAEL
Enzo...
ENZO
Yes, Enzo...
MICHAEL
You better get out of here, Enzo; there's
gonna be trouble...
ENZO
If there is trouble, I stay here to help
you. For your father...for your father.
MICHAEL
Alright... Listen, wait for me outside in
front of the hospital. Alright? I'll be
out in a minute. Go ahead...
ENZO
Okay... okay.
Michael returns to the Don's room, at his bedside. The nurse is
still in the room.
MICHAEL
Just lie here, Pop. I'll take care of you
now. I'm with you now. I'm with you...
Michael kisses the Don's hand; the Don smiles, with a tear in his
eye. Michael leaves to meet Enzo outside of the hospital.
MICHAEL
(grabbing and tossing the
flowers that Enzo is still
holding)
Get rid of these
(more)
50
MICHAEL (Cont'd)
(as Michael turns Enzo's
collar up)
Come 'ere... Put your hand in your pocket
like you have a gun. You'll be alright.
(after he sighs)
You'll be okay...
A black car pulls up to the front of the hospital. The occupants
look at Michael and Enzo, as Michael undoes a button of his coat
and puts his hand in, as if he had a gun. The car then drives off.
MICHAEL
You did good.
Enzo, very scared, takes out a cigarette and has trouble lighting
it with his Zippo lighter. His hands are shaking. Michael takes
the lighter and lights his cigarette, noticing that his hands are
not shaking. Moments later, sirens are heard as police cars
screech to a halt in front of the hospital. Michael shoos Enzo
away as he is grabbed by an officer.
OFFICER
(grabbing Michael)
Now hold still...
CAPTAIN MCCLUSKEY
(entering the scene)
I thought I got all you guinea hoods
locked up! What the hell are you doing
here?
MICHAEL
What happened to the men who were guarding
my father, captain?
MCCLUSKEY
Why you little punk! What the hell are you
doing telling me my business? I pulled
them guys off of here, eh! Now you get
outta here and stay away from this
hospital!
MICHAEL
I'm not moving until you put some guards
around my father's room.
MCCLUSKEY
Phil, take him in!
OFFICER PHIL
The kid's clean, Captain. He's a war hero.
He's never been busted for the rackets...
51
MCCLUSKEY
(overlaps)
Goddamn it, I said take him in!
MICHAEL
What's the Turk paying you to set up my
father, Captain?
MCCLUSKEY
Take a hold of him. Stand him up. Stand'im
up straight.
McCluskey punches Michael in the jaw as a Corleone car screeches
up. Men get out and run up the steps toward the Don's room. Tom
and a couple of men go to get Michael.
TOM
I'm attorney for the Corleone family.
These men are private detectives hired to
protect Vito Corleone. They're licensed to
carry firearms. If you interfere, you'll
have to appear before a judge in the
morning and show cause.
MCCLUSKEY
(to his officers)
Alright... let'im go.
(inaudible "Shit!" as he
turns away)
Come on!
DISSOLVE TO:
CORLEONE MALL – DAY
Clemenza and Michael get out of a car and walk through the gate,
noticing armed men all over the mall. Tessio greets them.
CLEMENZA
What's with all the new faces?
TESSIO
We'll need'em now. After the hospital
thing, Sonny got mad. We hit Bruno
Tattaglia 4 o'clock this morning.
CLEMENZA
Jesus Christ...
(motions to Michael to come
on)
It looks like a fortress around here...
CUT TO:
52
INSIDE THE CORLEONE OFFICE – DAY
SONNY
(to Tom)
Tom-anuch! Hey, a hundred button men on
the street twenty-four hours a day; that
Turk shows one hair on his ass, he's dead.
TOM
(going to sit down)
Yeah?
SONNY
Believe me...
(to Michael, whose face is
bruised from McCluskey's
punch)
Hey, Michael, come're, let me look at you.
You look beautiful! Beautiful! Just
gorgeous!
(to Tom)
Hey, listen to this...the Turk wants to
talk. Eh gosh...imagine the nerve of the
sonofabitch, eh? Craps out last night, and
wants a meetin' today...
TOM
What did he say?
SONNY
What did he say...Badda-beep, badda-bap,
badda-boop, badda-beep. He wants us to
send Michael here to proposition. And the
promise is, that the deal is so good, that
we can't refuse. Eh...
TOM
(as Tessio enters the room)
What about Bruno Tattaglia?
SONNY
That's part of the deal. Bruno cancels out
what they did to my father...
TOM
Sonny, we ought to hear what they have to
say...
SONNY
(standing in front of Tom,
who's seated)
No, no, no! No more! Not this time,
consiglieri. No more meetin's, no more
discussions, no more Sollozzo tricks. You
(more)
53
SONNY (Cont'd)
give'em one message: I want Sollozzo...if
not, it's all-out war...we go to the
mattresses...
TOM
(stands)
Some of the other families won't sit still
for all-out war!
SONNY
Then they hand me Sollozzo!
TOM
You're father wouldn't want to hear this!
This is business, not personal, Sonny !
SONNY
They shot my father...that's business?
Your ass...
TOM
Even the shooting of your father was
business, not personal, Sonny!
SONNY
(now seated behind the desk)
Well, then, business will have to suffer,
alright? And listen...do me a favor , Tom.
No more advice on how to patch things up,
please. Just help me win, please, alright?
TOM
(after they settle down)
I found out about this Captain McCluskey
who broke Mike's jaw...
SONNY
What about 'im?
TOM
Now he's definitely on Sollozzo's payroll,
and for big money. McCluskey has agreed to
be the Turk's bodyguard. What you have to
understand, Sonny, is that while Sollozzo
is being guarded like this, he is
invulnerable. Now nobody has ever gunned
down a New York police captain...never. It
would be disastrous. All the Five Families
would come after you, Sonny. The Corleone
Family would be outcasts! Even the old
man's political protection would run for
cover! So do me a favor take this into
consideration.
54
SONNY
Alright. We'll wait.
MICHAEL
We can't wait.
SONNY
Huh?
MICHAEL
(who's seated with his arms
on the chair's arms)
We can't wait. I don't care what Sollozzo
says about a deal, he's gonna kill Pop,
that's it. That's the key for him. Gotta
get Sollozzo.
CLEMENZA
Mike is right...
SONNY
Lemme ask you something...? What about
McCluskey? Huh? What do we do with this
cop here?
MICHAEL
They wanna to have a meeting with me,
right? It will be me, McCluskey and
Sollozzo. Let's set the meeting. Get our
informers to find out where it's gonna be
held. Now, we insist it's a public
place...a bar, a restaurant...some place
where there's people so I feel safe.
They're gonna search me when I first meet
them, right? so I can't have a weapon on
me then. But if Clemenza can figure a way
to have a weapon planted there for me,
then I'll kill 'em both.
Clemenza, Tessio and Sonny laugh. Tom shrugs.
SONNY
Hey, whataya gonna do, nice college boy,
eh? Didn't want to get mixed up in the
Family business, huh? Now you wanna gun
down a police captain, why, because he
slapped ya in the face a little bit? Hah?
What do you think this is, the Army, where
you shoot 'em a mile away? You've gotta
get up close like this and bada-bing! you
blow their brains all over your nice Ivy
League suit. Come're...
MICHAEL
(as Sonny kisses his head)
Sonny...
55
SONNY
You're taking this very personal. Tom,
this is business and this man is taking it
very very personal.
MICHAEL
Where does it say that you can't kill a
cop?
HAGEN
Come on, Mikey...
MICHAEL
Tom, wait a minute. I'm talking about a
cop that's mixed up in drugs. I'm talking
about ah... ah... a dishonest cop...a
crooked cop who got mixed up in the
rackets and got what was coming to him.
That's a terrific story. And we have
newspaper people on the pay roll, don't
we, Tom? Hagen nods in the affirmative.
And they might like a story like that.
HAGEN
They might, they just might...
MICHAEL
It's not personal, Sonny. It's strictly
business.
CUT TO:
CLEMENZA'S CELLAR – DAY
Clemenza is showing Michael the gun he's to use.
CLEMENZA
It's as cold as they come...impossible to
trace, so you don't worry about prints,
Mike. I put a special tape on the trigger,
and the butt. Here, try it...
(after Michael tries it but
doesn't shoot it)
What's the matter, the trigger too tight?
MICHAEL
(after shooting the gun)
Oh, my ears...
CLEMENZA
(laughs)
Yeah, I left it noisy – that way it scares
any pain-in-the-ass innocent bystanders
away.
(more)
56
CLEMENSA (Cont'd)
(then)
All right, you shot'em both...now what do
you do?
MICHAEL
Sit down, finish my dinner...
CLEMENZA
Come on kid, don't fool around. Just let
your hand drop to your side, and let the
gun slip out. Everybody'll still think you
got it. They're gonna be staring at your
face, Mike...so walk outta the place real
fast but you don't run. Don't look nobody
directly in the eye...but you don't look
away, either. Hey, they're gonna be scared
still of you, believe me, so don't worry
about nothin'. You know, you're going to
turn out all right. You take a long
vacation...nobody knows where and we're
gonna catch the hell.
MICHAEL
How bad do you think it's gonna be?
CLEMENZA
Pretty goddamn bad. Probably all the other
Families will line up against us. That's
alright...this things gotta happen every
five years or so...ten years helps to get
rid of the bad blood. Been ten years since
the last one. You know you got to stop
them at the beginning, like they should
have stopped Hitler at Munich, They
should've never let him get away with
that. They were just asking for big
trouble. You know, Mike, we was all proud
of you – being a hero and all. Your
father, too.
Clemenza hands Michael the gun after adjusting it. Michael points
and fires the unloaded gun.
CUT TO:
THE CORLEONE DINING ROOM (6:30PM)
Sonny, Clemenza, Tessio and Rocco are sitting around, eating
Chinese food while waiting for news about where the Sollozzo
meeting will take place. Michael smokes as the others eat.
57
TOM
(as he enters)
Nothing. Not a hint. Absolutely nothing.
Even Sollozzo's people don't know where
the meeting's going to be held.
MICHAEL
How much time do we have?
SONNY
(checking his watch)
They're gonna pick you up in front of Jack
Dempsey's joint in an hour and a half.
Exactly an hour and a half.
CLEMENZA
We could put a tail on them and see how it
turns out...
SONNY
Sollozzo'd lose our ass going around the
block!
TOM
What about the negotiator?
CLEMENZA
He's over at my place playin' pinochle
with a couple of my men. He's happy, the
y're lettin' him win...
TOM
There's too much of a risk for Mike. Maybe
we outta call it off, Sonny.
CLEMENZA
The negotiator keeps on playing cards
until Mike comes back safe and sound.
SONNY
So why don't he just blast whoever's in
the goddamn car?
CLEMENZA
Too dangerous – they'd be lookin' for
that.
TOM
Sollozzo might not even be in the car,
Sonny!
The phone rings, Sonny gets up to get it.
58
SONNY
I'll get it.
(into the phone)
Yeah...Yeah...Well, thanks...
(after hanging up the phone
and returning to the table)
Louis' Restaurant in the Bronx.
TOM
Well is it reliable?
SONNY
That's my man in McCluskey's precinct. A
police captain's gotta be on call twenty-
four hours a day. He signed out at that
number between eight and ten. Anybody know
this joint?
TESSIO
Yeah, sure, I do. It's perfect for us. A
small family place, good food. Everyone
minds his business. It's perfect. Pete
they got an old-fashion toilet...you know,
the box, and... and... and... ah the
chain-thing. We might be able to tape the
gun behind it.
CLEMENZA
All right, Mike: you go to the restaurant,
you eat, you talk for a while, you relax.
You make them relax. Then you get up and
you go take a leak. No...better
still...you ask for permission to go. Then
when you come back, you come out blastin',
and don't take any chances...two shots in
the head apiece.
SONNY
Listen, I want somebody good and I mean
very good...to plant that gun. I don't
want my brother coming out of that toilet
with just his dick in his hands, alright?
CLEMENZA
The gun'll be there...
SONNY
All right
(to Tessio)
Listen, you drive him and you pick him up
after the job, okay?
CLEMENZA
Come on, let's move...
As they're standing by the door, preparing to leave.
59
MICHAEL'S VOICE (O.S.)
Thank you, Tom...
SONNY
Did he...ah...tell you to drop the gun
right away?
MICHAEL
Yeah, a million times.
CLEMENZA
You don't forget: two shots apiece in the
head soon as you come out the door, ah?
Let's go...
MICHAEL
How long do you think it'll be before I
can come back?
SONNY
At least a year, Mike. Listen...um...I'll
square it with Mom, uh – you know, you're
not seeing her before you leave; and uh,
I'll get a message to that girlfriend,
when I think the time is right.
(after he and Michael
embrace)
Take care, huh?
TOM
Take care, Mike...
MICHAEL
(embracing Tom)
Tom.
DISSOLVE TO:
JACK DEMPSEY'S RESTAURANT (8:00PM)
Michael's waiting on the sidewalk until Sollozzo's car pulls up
and he gets in.
SOLLOZZO
I'm glad you came, Mike. I hope we can
straighten everything out. I mean, this is
terrible. It's not the way I wanted things
to go at all. It should've never happened.
MICHAEL
We'll straighten everything out tonight. I
don't want my father bothered any more...
60
SOLLOZZO
He won't be, Mike; I swear on my children
he won't be. But you gotta keep an op en
mind when we talk. I mean, I hope you're
not a hothead like your brother Sonny. You
can't talk business with him... something
in Italian.
MCCLUSKEY
Ahh, he's a good kid.
(as he leans forward)
I'm sorry about the other night, Mike. I
gotta frisk you, so turn around uh...on
your knees, facing me.
(as McCluskey frisks
Michael)
Ah, I guess I'm gettin' too old for my
job. Too grouchy...can't stand the
aggravation. You know how it is...
(to Sollozzo)
He's clean.
A little while later, as the car begins to cross the Triborough
bridge. Michael notices the sign that says "To New Jersey".
MICHAEL
We're goin' to Jersey?
SOLLOZZO
Maybe...
Sollozzo's car does a high-speed U-turn, cutting off cars who
sound there horn, as he crosses over the road's divider into the
other direction across the bridge.
SOLLOZZO
Nice work, Lou.
Later, the car pulls up to Louis' Italian-American Restaurant.
They go in.
DISSOLVE TO:
AT A TABLE IN LOUIS' ITALIAN RESTAURANT
The waiter brings a bottle of wine to the table.
MCCLUSKEY
How's the Italian food in this restaurant?
SOLLOZZO
Good...try the veal...it's the best in the
city.
MCCLUSKEY
I'll have it.
61
SOLLOZZO
(to the waiter)
Capide?
(after the waiter nods,
opens the bottle and pours
the wine)
All right.
(to McCluskey)
I'm gonna speak Italian to Mike.
MCCLUSKEY
Go ahead...
SOLLOZZO
Me dispiace?
(after Michael nods; in
Italian)
What happened to your father was business?
I have much respect for your father but
your father...his thinking is old
fashioned. You must understand why I had
to do that...
MICHAEL
(in Italian)
I understand that...
SOLLOZZO
(after the waiter brings
McCluskey's veal and leaves;
in Italian)
Now let's work through where we go from
here...
MICHAEL
... come si diche...?
(in English)
What I want? What's most important to me
is that I have a guarantee: No more
attempts on my father's life.
SOLLOZZO
What guarantees could I give you, Mike? I
am the hunted one! I missed my chance. You
think too much of me, kid. I'm not that
clever. All I want, is a truce.
MICHAEL
(after a while)
I have to go to the bathroom. Is that all
right?
62
MCCLUSKEY
(while eating)
You gotta go, you gotta go...
(after Sollozzo begins to
frisk Michael as he's
standing)
I frisked him – he's clean.
SOLLOZZO
Don't take too long...
MCCLUSKEY
(while watching Michael
enter the bathroom)
I've frisked a thousand young punks...
CUT TO:
INSIDE THE RESTROOM
Mike's looking for the gun behind the tank. He can't find it.
CUT TO:

McCluskey glances up again.
CUT TO:

Where Michael hesitates by the door, preparing himself as a train
is loudly heard passing close by, just before he goes back to the
dining area.
CUT TO:
DINING ROOM
Sollozzo and McCluskey watch Michael emerge from the restroom,
hesitate at the door, then sit down.
63
SOLLOZZO
(voice fading into
background)
(in Italian)
Everything alright? – Look – Your
father...
Michael doesn't pay attention to Sollozzo – he's under too much
mental anguish. He rises, and quickly shoots Sollozzo in the head.
He shoots McCluskey in the throat, then the forehead as McCluskey
holds his throat. McCluskey falls, overturning the table. Michael
goes to exit, dropping the gun. Outside, Michael gets picked up by
Tessio, and they speed off.

There's been a lot of bad blood.
SONNY
They hit us so...we hit 'em back.
67
TOM
Through our contacts in the newspapers,
we've been able to put out a lot of

SICILIAN COUNTRYSIDE
During the day. "The Love Theme".
Michael is walking with his bodyguards, Fabrizio and Calo. A car
drives up to them and stops. Fabrizio opens the door for
Tommasino.
FABRIZIO
(in Italian)
I kiss your hand, Don Tommasino.
TOMMASINO
(in Italian)
Michele, Why are you so far from the
house? You know I'm responsible to your
father for your life.
MICHAEL
(in Italian)
I'm with Calo and Fabrizio...
TOMMASINO
(in Italian)
It's still dangerous. We've heard from
Santino in New York. Your enemies know
you're here.
MICHAEL
(in Italian)
Did Santino say when I can go back?
TOMMASINO
(in Italian)
Not yet. It's out of the question.

Grazie.

I'm the son of a pezzonovante.
FABRIZIO
(in Italian)
Ah...Is America as rich as they say?
CALO
(sunbathing; in Italian)
Stop bothering me with this rich America
stuff!
72
FABRIZIO
(to Calo; in Italian)
Eh, shut up...
(to Michael, in English)
Eh, take me to America. If you need a good
lupara in America, take me...I'd be the

FABRIZIO

MICHAEL

Sonny punches and kicks Carlo while bodyguards hold back on-
lookers. Carlo screams when Sonny bites his knuckles which are

Maybe I will! Why not? Yeah you,

Yeah yeah...come on now, kill me. Be a

having a problem moving and Sonny sounds his horn.
SONNY
Son-of-a-bitch! Come on! Come on!
The toll-collector "drops" Sonny's change, and bends to pick it
up, sliding the booth's door shut. Sonny turns his head and
notices a line of armed men pointing their weapons at him. A
fusillade of shots pelt the car, and Sonny, as he stumbles out
screaming. Once fallen and dead, a hitman comes up and shoots him
from very close range, stops, then kicks him in the head. The
assassins flee before the Corleone car shows up.

Ah, I didn't tell Mama anything. I was

DISSOLVE TO:
BANK BUILDING BOARDROOM – NEW YORK CITY  – DAY
There are Dons and aides seated and standing around a conference
table. Barzini sits at the head of the table.
VITO CORLEONE
Don Barzini, I want to thank you for
helping me organize this  meeting here
today. And also the other heads of the
Five Families, New York and New Jersey.
Carmine Corleone from the Bronx and ah...
Brooklyn...Philip Tattaglia.  An' from
Staten Island, we have with us Victor
Strachi. And all the other associates that
came as far as from California, and Kansas
City, and all the other territories of the
country...thank you.
(sitting down)
How did things ever get so far? I don't
know. It was so unfortunate...so
unnecessary. Tattaglia lost a son and I
lost a son. We're quits. And if Tattaglia
agrees, then I'm willing to let things go
on the way they were before...
BARZINI
We're all grateful to Don Corleone for
calling this meeting. We all know him as a
man of his word...a modest man...he'll
always listen to reason...
TATTAGLIA
Yes, Don Barzini...he's too modest. He had
all the judges and politicians in his
pocket. He refused to share them...
VITO CORLEONE
When...when did I ever refuse an
accommodation? All of you know me here.
When did I ever refuse? Except one time.
And why? Because I believe this drug
business is gonna destroy us in the years
to come. I mean, it's not like gambling or
liquor...even women, which is something
that most people want nowadays, and is ah
forbidden to them by the pezzonovante of
the Church. Even the police departments
that've helped us in the past with
gambling and other things are gonna refuse
to help us when in comes to narcotics. And
I believed that then and I believe that
now.
93
BARZINI
Times have changed. It's not like the Old
Days when we can do anything we want. A
refusal is not the act of a friend. If Don
Corleone had all the judges, and the
politicians in New York, then he must
share them, or let us others use them. He
must let us draw the water from the well.
Certainly he can present a bill for such
services; after all we are not Communists.
ZALUCHI
(after some laughter from
the group, stands)
I also don't believe in drugs. For years I
paid my people extra so they wouldn't do
that kind of business.
Tattaglia whispers something to his aide.
ZALUCHI
(continues)
Somebody comes to them and says, "I have
powders; if you put up three, four
thousand dollar investment we can make
fifty thousand distributing." So they
can't resist. I want to control it as a
business, to keep it respectable.
(as he slams his hand on the
table)
I don't want it near schools. I don't want
it sold to children! That's an infamia. In
my city, we would keep the traffic in the
dark people – the colored. They're animals
anyway, so let them lose their souls...
VITO CORLEONE
I hoped that we would come here and reason
together. And as a reasonable man I'm
willing to do whatever's necessary to find
a peaceful solution to these problems...
BARZINI
Then we are agreed. The traffic in drugs
will be permitted, but controlled and Don
Corleone will give up protection in the
East and there will be the peace.
TATTAGLIA
But I must have strict assurance from
Corleone as time goes by and his position
becomes stronger, will he attempt any
individual vendetta?
94
BARZINI
Look, we are all reasonable men here; we
don't have to give assurances as if we
were lawyers...
VITO CORLEONE
(holding up his hand to
interrupt Barzini)
You talk about vengeance...is vengeance
gonna bring your son back to you? Or my
boy to me? I forgo the vengeance of my son
But I have selfish reasons. My youngest
son was forced to leave this country...
(as he stands, with Tom's
assistance)
Because of this Sollozzo business. All
right ... and I have to make arrangements
to bring him back here safely – cleared of
all these false charges. But I'm a
superstitious man and if some unlucky
accident should befall him...if he should
get shot in the head by a police officer
or if he should hang himself in his jail
cell or if he's struck by a bolt of
lightning then I'm going to blame some of
the people in this room. And that, I do
not forgive.
(then)
But that aside let me say that I swear on
the souls of my grandchildren that I will
not be the one to break the peace that we
have made here today...
The Don and Tom move toward the head of the table where Barzini is
sitting. Tattaglia does the same. The Don and Tattaglia embrace as
the others applaud.
CUT TO:
THE DON'S CAR DRIVING – NIGHT
Inside the car where the Don and Tom are sitting in the rear.
TOM
When I meet with the Tattaglia people,
should I insist that all his drug
middlemen have clean records?
VITO CORLEONE
Mention it. Don't insist. Barzini is a man
who'll know that without being told.
TOM
You mean Tattaglia...
95
VITO CORLEONE
Tattaglia's a pimp...he never'a could've
outfought Santino. But I didn't know until
this day that it was Barzini all along...
Michael, who has returned from Sicily, is walking and talking with
the Don in the Don's garden.
VITO CORLEONE
Look at this tomatoes, peppers...all of
this perfecto...
MICHAEL
Pop, what about Sonny?
(then)
What about Sicily?
VITO CORLEONE
I swore that I would never break the
peace.
MICHAEL
But won't they take that as a sign of
weakness?
VITO CORLEONE
It is a sign of weakness...
MICHAEL
Well you gave your word that you wouldn't
break the peace, I didn't give mine. You
don't have to have any part. I take all
responsibility.
VITO CORLEONE
Well, we have a lot of time to talk about
it now.
CUT TO:
NEW HAMPSHIRE SCHOOL – DAY
Kay leads a group of children into schoolyard.
KAY
(to the children)
Come on, Nancy...keep together, everyone.
Blanche. Okay, all right...
(when Kay notices Michael
standing beside his
Cadillac)
How long have you been back?
96
MICHAEL
I've been back a year. Longer than that, I
think.
(then)
It's good to see you, Kay...
DISSOLVE TO:
COUNTRY ROAD – DAY
Michael and Kay are walking together as Michael's car follows
behind.  A boy on his bike passes, followed by his dog.
BOY
(as he passes)
Come on, Dano!
MICHAEL
I'm working for my father now, Kay. He's
been sick...very sick.
KAY
But you're not like him, Michael. I
thought you weren't going to become a man
like your father. That's what you told
me...
MICHAEL
My father's no different than any other
powerful man.
(after Kay laughs)
Any man who's responsible for other
people. Like a senator or a president.
KAY
You know how naive you sound?
MICHAEL
Why?
KAY
Senators and presidents don't have men
killed...
MICHAEL
Oh who's being naive, Kay?
(then)
Kay, my father's way of doing things is
over...it's finished. Even he knows that.
I mean in five years, the Corleone Family
is going to be completely legitimate.
Trust me. That's all I can tell you about
my business
(then)
Kay...
97
KAY
Michael, why did you come here? Why? What
do you want with me after all this time?
Here I was calling and writing...
MICHAEL
I came here because I need you ... because
I care for you.
KAY
Please stop it, Michael...
MICHAEL
Because I want you to marry me...
KAY
(shaking her head)
It's too late...it's too late...
MICHAEL
Please, Kay I'll do anything you ask ...
anything to make up for what's happened to
us...
(after Kay shakes her head)
... because that's important Kay. Because
what's important is that we have each
other. That we have a life together that
we have children. Our children...
(after Kay puts her hands to
her face)
Kay I need you. And I love you.
Michael beckons toward the car. Michael and Kay get in.
DISSOLVE TO:
THE DON'S OFFICE
The Don is feeding the fish in his aquarium.
TESSIO'S VOICE (O.S.)
(to Michael)
Barzini's people chisel my territory, and
we do nothing about it. Pretty soon there
won't be one place in Brooklyn I can hang
my hat!
MICHAEL'S VOICE (O.S.)
Just be patient...
TESSIO'S VOICE (O.S.)
I'm not asking you for help, Mike – just
take off the handcuffs.
MICHAEL'S VOICE (O.S.)
Be patient.
98
CLEMENZA'S VOICE (O.S.)
We got to protect ourselves. Give me a
chance to recruit some new men.
MICHAEL'S VOICE (O.S.)
No I don't want to give Barzini an excuse
to start fighting.
TESSIO'S VOICE (O.S.)
Mike, you're wrong...
CLEMENZA
(to the Don)
Don Corleone you once said that the day
would come when Tessio and me could form
our own Family. Til today, I would never
think of it. I must ask your permission...
VITO CORLEONE
(looking away)
Well, Michael is now head of the Family,
and if he gives his permission, then you
have my blessing...
MICHAEL
(seated on a chair)
After we make the move to Nevada you can
break off from the Corleone Family and go
on your own. After we make the move to
Nevada.
CLEMENZA
How long with that be?
MICHAEL
Six months.
TESSIO
(to Don Vito)
Forgive me, Godfather, but with you gone
me and Pete'll come under Barzini's thumb
sooner or later...
CLEMENZA
And I hate that goddamn Barzini! In six
months' time there won't be nothing left
to build on...
VITO CORLEONE
Do you have faith in my judgment?
CLEMENZA
Yes...
VITO CORLEONE
Do I have your loyalty?
99
CLEMENZA
Yes – always, Godfather...
VITO CORLEONE
Then be a friend to Michael, and do as he
says.
MICHAEL
(who is now seated behind
the desk)
There are things being negotiated now that
are gonna solve all your problems and
answer all your questions. That's all I
can tell you now...
(to Carlo)
Carlo, you grew up in Nevada. When we make
our move there, you're gonna be my right-
hand man.
(to the group)
Tom Hagen's no longer Consiglieri. He's
gonna be our lawyer in Vegas. That's no
reflection on Tom, but that's the way I
want it.
(then)
Besides if I ever need help, who's a
better Consiglieri than my father? Well,
that's it.
Rocco opens the door to let everyone leave. Clemenza walks past
Michael, shakes Don Vito's hand, and exits.
TESSIO
(shaking Michael's hand)
Alright...
Tessio walks past Don Vito as he exits. As Carlo exits, Vito
pinches Carlo's cheeks.
CARLO
Thank you, Papa...
VITO CORLEONE
I'm happy for you, Carlo.
TOM
(seated on the couch)
Mike, uh why am I out?
MICHAEL
You're not a wartime Consiglieri, Tom.
Things may get rough with the move we're
trying.
100
VITO CORLEONE
(sitting next to Tom on the
couch)
Tom I advise Michael. I never thought you
were a bad Consiglieri. I thought Santino
was a bad Don, rest in peace. Michael has
all my confidence, as...as you do. But uh
there are reasons why you must have no
part in what is going to happen.
TOM
(to Michael)
Maybe I could help...
MICHAEL
(curtly)
You're out, Tom.
Don Vito pats Tom on the shoulder, gets up, and walks over to
Michael. He pats Michael on the chest, then his face.
DISSOLVE TO:
A MONTAGE OF LAS VEGAS
The Desert Inn featuring Patti Page, El Rancho Vegas featuring Joe
E. Lewis & Gloria DeHave, and the Sands featuring Dean Martin &
Jerry Lewis. We hear Vegas-style music.
DISSOLVE TO:
LAS VEGAS HOTEL
A limo drives to the entrance, and Fredo and Michael get out.
DISSOLVE TO:
Fredo, Michael, Hagen, Neri, Rocco and bellboys walk towards a
hotel room.
FREDO
(to Michael)
I can't get over the way your face
looks... it really looks good. This doctor
did some job. Who talked you into it, Kay?
(to the bellboys carrying
the luggage)
Hey hey hey hey hey, wait! Hey – leave
them out here we'll deal with them
later...
(after the bellboys stop)
He's tired – he wants to clean up. But
right now, let me open the door, alright?
Fredo opens the door. From the room comes music as Fredo waltzes
in. The band, consisting of an accordion, a standup bass, and a
piano, plays "For He's a Jolly Good Fellow." There are four Vegas
101
girls sitting around the table as the band then plays "Mona Lisa."
Michael is not pleased. Johnny Fontane is standing behind the
table.
JOHNNY
Hello, Mike. Welcome to Las Vegas!
FREDO
It's all for you, kid – eh
(towards Johnny)
It's all his idea, right? Didn't you?
JOHNNY
Well, your brother Freddy...
FREDO
Well it was – hey, girls here...
Hah...I'll be right back...
JOHNNY
(to Fredo)
All right...okay
FREDO
(to Johnny)
You keep 'em occupied...
(to Michael)
Anything you want, kid...anything. Huh?
MICHAEL
(curtly)
Who are the girls?
FREDO
That's for you to find out...
MICHAEL
Get rid of them, Fredo.
FREDO
Hey, Mike... uh...
MICHAEL
Fredo, I'm here on business. I leave
tomorrow, now get rid of them. I'm tired.
(exiting the shot)
Get rid of the band, too.
FREDO
(to the girls)
Hey, just take off! Come on, take off!
Let's go. Hey – Angelo...
(then)
Hey, come on. SCRAM!
102
JOHNNY
(to the blonde he kisses)
Come on, honey, let's go
FREDO
(to Johnny)
Come on... I don't know, Johnny. I don't
know what the hell's the matter with him.
(to a girl)
I'm sorry, babe, come on...
(to the band)
I don't know, he's tired... he's...
MICHAEL
What happened to Moe Greene?
FREDO
He said he had some business. He said give
him a call when the party started.
MICHAEL
Well give him a call.
(to Johnny, as they shake
hands)
Johnny, how are you?
JOHNNY
Hello, Mike nice to see you again.
MICHAEL
We're all proud of you...
JOHNNY
Thanks, Mike.
MICHAEL
Sit down, Johnny – I want to talk to you.
(then)
The Don's proud of you, too, Johnny.
JOHNNY
Well I uh, owe it all to him.
MICHAEL
Well he knows how grateful you are. That's
why he'd like to ask a favor of you...
JOHNNY
Mike, what can I do?
103
MICHAEL
The Corleone Family is thinking of giving
up all its interests in the olive oil
business – settling out here.
(after Johnny hmmms)
Now Moe Greene will sell us his share of
the casino and the hotel so it could be
completely owned by the Family.
(gesturing towards Tom)
Tom.
FREDO
Hey, Mike, are you sure about that? Moe
loves the business – he never said nothin'
to me about selling...
MICHAEL
Yeah well I'll make him an offer he can't
refuse.
(after Tom hands Michael a
set of contracts)
See, Johnny...see we figure that
entertainment will be a big factor in
drawing gamblers to the casino. And, we
hope you'll sign a contract to appear five
times a year.
(then)
Perhaps uh...convince some of your friends
in the movies to do the same. We're
counting on you...
JOHNNY
Sure, Mike. I'll do anything for my
Godfather...you know that.
MICHAEL
(as he and Johnny shake
hands)
Good.
MOE GREEN
(as he enters the room)
Hey, Mike! Hello, fellas...everybody's
here. Freddy. Tom. Good to see you,
Mike...
MICHAEL
(shaking Moe's hand)
How are you, Moe?
104
MOE
(to Mike, as Johnny exits)
All right you got everything you want? The
chef cooked for you special...the dancers
will kick your tongue out, and your credit
is good.
(to one of Moe's employees)
Draw chips for everybody in the room so
they can play on the house.
MICHAEL
(as Moe sits down)
My credit good enough to buy you out?
MOE
(laughs, and so does Fredo
who massages Moe's back)
Buy me out?
MICHAEL
The casino...the hotel. Corleone Family
wants to buy you out.
MOE
(angry)
The Corleone Family wants to buy me out?
No. I buy you out, you don't buy me out.
MICHAEL
Your casino loses money. Maybe we can do
better...
MOE
You think I'm skimmin' off the top, Mike?
MICHAEL
You're unlucky
MOE
(standing, angrily laughs)
You goddamn guineas really make me laugh.
I do you a favor and take Freddie in when
you're having a bad time, and then you try
to push me out!
MICHAEL
Wait a minute. You took Freddie in because
the Corleone Family bankrolled your casino
because the Molinari Family on the Coast
guaranteed his safety. Now we're talking
business. Let's talk business...
105
MOE
Yeah  let's talk business, Mike. First of
all, you're all done. The Corleone Family
don't even have that kind of muscle
anymore. The Godfather's sick, right?
You're getting chased out of New York by
Barzini and the other Families. What do
you think is going on here? You think you
can come to my hotel and take over? I
talked to Barzini. I can make a deal with
him, and still keep my hotel!
MICHAEL
Is that why you slapped my brother around
in public?
FREDO
Aw now that...that was nothin', Mike. Now
uh Moe didn't mean nothin' by that. Sure
he flies off the handle once in a while,
but Moe and me we're good friends, right
Moe? Huh?
MOE
I gotta business to run. I gotta kick
asses sometimes to make it run right. We
had a little argument, Freddy and I, so I
had to straighten him out...
MICHAEL
You straightened my brother out?
MOE
He was banging cocktail waitresses two at
a time! Players couldn't get a drink at
the table! What's wrong with you?
MICHAEL
(collecting his things from
the table before he stands)
I leave for New York tomorrow. Think about
a price.
MOE
(angry)
Son-of-a-bitch – Do you know who I am? I'm
Moe Greene! I made my bones when you were
going out with cheerleaders!
FREDO
Wait a minute, Moe...Moe, I got an idea...
(to Tom)
Tom...Tom, you're the Consiglieri and you
can talk to the Don – you can explain...
106
TOM
Just a minute now – the Don is semi-
retired and Mike is in charge of the
Family business now. If you have anything
to say, say it to Michael.
FREDO
(after Moe storms out)
Mike! You don't come to Las Vegas and talk
to a man like Moe Greene like that!
MICHAEL
Fredo – you're my older brother, and I
love you. But don't ever take sides with
anyone against the Family again. Ever.
CUT TO:
CORLEONE MALL
Michael's limo drives through the gate with him, Kay, and Anthony.
Anthony is sitting on Michael's lap.
MICHAEL
I have to see my father and his people, so
have dinner without me...
KAY
Oh, Michael...
MICHAEL
This weekend we'll go out.
(after Kay hmmmms)
We'll go to the city. We'll see a show and
we'll have dinner. I promise.
KAY
(after she and Michael kiss)
Okay...
(then)
Oh, Michael. Michael, your sister wants to
ask you something...
MICHAEL
Well let her ask...
KAY
No she's afraid to. Connie and Carlo want
you to be Godfather to their little boy.
MICHAEL
Oh, well we'll see...
KAY
Will you?
107
MICHAEL
Lemme think about it – we'll see. Come on.
DISSOLVE TO:
THE DON'S GARDEN
The Don, older looking now, sits with Michael.
VITO CORLEONE
So Barzini will move against you first.
He'll set up a meeting with someone that
you absolutely trust...guaranteeing your
safety. And at that meeting, you'll be
assassinated.
(as the Don drinks from a
glass of wine as Michael
watches him)
I like to drink wine more than I used to
anyway, I'm drinking more...
MICHAEL
It's good for you, Pop.
VITO CORLEONE
(after a long pause)
I don't know your wife and children. Are
you happy with them?
MICHAEL
Very happy...
VITO CORLEONE
That's good.
(then)
I hope you don't mind the way I...I keep
going over this Barzini business...
MICHAEL
No, not at all...
VITO CORLEONE
It's an old habit. I spent my life trying
not to be careless. Women and children can
be careless, but not men.
(then)
How's your boy?
MICHAEL
He's good.
VITO CORLEONE
You know he looks more like you every day.
108
MICHAEL
(smiling)
He's smarter than I am. Three years old,
he can read the funny papers
VITO CORLEONE
(laughs)
Read the funny papers.
(then)
Oh...well...eh, I want you to arrange to
have a telephone man check all the calls
that go in and out of here because...
MICHAEL
I did it already, Pop.
VITO CORLEONE
Ya know, cuz it could be anyone...
MICHAEL
Pop, I took care of that.
VITO CORLEONE
Oh, that's right. I forgot.
MICHAEL
(reaching over, touching his
father)
What's the matter? What's bothering you?
(after the Don doesn't
answer)
I'll handle it. I told you I can handle
it, I'll handle it.
VITO CORLEONE
(as he stands)
I knew that Santino was going to have to
go through all this. And Fredo...well...
(after he sits besides
Michael)
Fredo was...well. But I never...I never
wanted this for you. I work my whole life,
I don't apologize, to take care of my
family. And I refused to be a fool dancing
on the string, held by all those bigshots.
I don't apologize that's my life but I
thought that...that when it was your time
that...that you would be the one to hold
the strings. Senator Corleone. Governor
Corleone, or something...
MICHAEL
Another pezzonovante...
109
VITO CORLEONE
Well this wasn't enough time, Michael.
Wasn't enough time...
MICHAEL
We'll get there, Pop. We'll get there...
VITO CORLEONE
Uh...
(after kissing Michael on
the cheek)
Now listen. Whoever comes to you with this
Barzini meeting – he's the traitor. Don't
forget that.
DISSOLVE TO:
THE DON'S TOMATO GARDEN – DAY
The Don is with Michael's son, Anthony.
ANTHONY
Can I hold it, please?
(taking the spray can from
the Don)
Yeah, I will take care...
VITO CORLEONE
Come're...come're...come're
The Don shows Anthony how to use the spray can.
ANTHONY
Can I water these?
VITO CORLEONE
Yeah over here...over here. Be careful,
you're spilling it. You're spilling it...
(after Anthony sprays a
tomato plant)
Anthony...com'ere...com'ere...com'ere...
com'ere. There, that's right. We'll put it
right there. Aie watch this. Come here.
I'll show you something, come here. Now
you stand there...
The Don cuts a piece of orange.
ANTHONY
Give me orange...
The Don turns away and puts the piece of orange over his teeth. He
turns toward Anthony, grunting and holding his arms up like a
monster. Anthony is startled, and starts to cry. The Don rises,
grabbing the boy.
110
VITO CORLEONE
(laughing)
Oh no?
(after picking up Anthony
then setting him down again)
That's a new trick.
(pointing to the tomato
garden)
You run in there...run in there...
Anthony runs through the tomato garden, laughing, with the spray
can. He and the Don are chasing each other.
ANTHONY
(laughing)
See where are you?
(then)
Get down!
The Don takes the orange peel out of his mouth, laughs, then
coughs. He starts to fall, grabs for a plant, then falls to the
ground. Anthony is still laughing and running around.
ANTHONY
I love you...
(as he runs up to the Don
with the spray can)
Uh...uh...uh...uh...uh...uh...ouch!
Anthony, seeing the Don's lifeless body, runs to the house.
DISSOLVE TO:
CEMETERY – DAY
We hear church bells as a procession of cars drives in. Chauffeurs
open car doors to let mourners out, including that old man who
sang Luna Mezz'o Mare at Connie's wedding reception. Michael, Tom,
Mama, Connie and others are sitting in chairs in front of the
Don's flower-covered casket. They watch as mourners place single
red roses on top. We see Johnny, Clemenza, and his wife toss
roses. Barzini tosses a rose, and glances at Michael and nods. We
see Tessio walking from Barzini, towards Michael.
TESSIO
(into Michael's ear)
Mike, could I have a minute?
(after Michael and Tessio
move away from the others)
Barzini wants to arrange a meeting. He
says we can straighten any of our problems
out...
MICHAEL
You talked to him?
111
TESSIO
Yeah – I can arrange security. On my
territory. Alright?
MICHAEL
Alright...
TESSIO
Alright.
TOM
(after Michael sits besides
him again)
Do you know how they're gonna come at'cha?
MICHAEL
They're arranging a meeting in Brooklyn.
Tessio's ground, where I'll be "safe".
TOM
I always thought it would've been
Clemenza, not Tessio...
MICHAEL
It's a smart move – Tessio was always
smarter. But I'm gonna wait – after the
baptism. I've decided to be Godfather to
Connie's baby. And then I'll meet with Don
Barzini – and Tattaglia – all of the heads
of the Five Families...

I do renounce them.

Neri shoots Barzini's bodyguard twice, and his chauffeur once, as

at Barzini, who topples after two shots. Neri gets picked up.

The family is outside, congratulating Connie and Carlo.
MICHAEL
Kay...

CONNIE
(to the infant Michael
Francis, holding the baby
towards Michael)
Come on, kiss your Godfather...
Michael kisses the baby. Kay carries Anthony out. Rocco drives up
and goes to Michael, whispering in his ear. Michael responds
inaudibly. Rocco pats him then exits.
MICHAEL
Carlo can't go to Vegas. Something's come
up. Everybody's going to leave without us.
CONNIE
Oh, Mike it's our first vacation together.
CARLO
Hey Connie, please.
(to Michael)
What do you want?
MICHAEL
Go back to the house. Wait for my call.
It's important.
CARLO
(nodding and exiting)
All right.
MICHAEL
(to Kay)
I'll only be a couple of days...
Michael kisses Kay, pats Anthony's head, and kisses Mama.
MAMA
Statta bene... statta bene
The family and guests dissipate as the priest and monsignor ascend
the steps.

I hope Mike can get us a good deal

DISSOLVE TO:
CORLEONE GATE
Tessio and Tom leave the house. Willie Cicci stops them.
CICCI
Sal...Tom...the Boss says he'll come in a
separate car. He says for you two to go on
ahead...
TESSIO
Hell, he can't do that. It screws up all
my arrangements!
CICCI
Well, that's what he said.
TOM
(as another buttonman steps
up)
I can't go either, Sal.
TESSIO
(as he sees a third
buttonman step up)
Tell Mike it was only business. I always
liked him.
TOM
He understands that.
CICCI
(frisking Sal, taking his
gun)
Excuse me, Sal...
TESSIO
Huh?
(then)
Tom can you get me off the hook? For Ol'
Times' sake?
TOM
Can't do it, Sally.
Tom nods to buttonmen who take Sal to the car. Tom walks inside
and pauses to look out the window.
CUT TO:
CONNIE AND CARLO'S HOUSE – DAY
Tom, Michael, Neri and Rocco enter. Carlo hangs up the phone that
he was dialing.
119
MICHAEL
You have to answer for Santino, Carlo.
CARLO
Mike, you got it all wrong...
MICHAEL
You fingered Sonny for the Barzini people.
Ahhh that little farce you played with my
sister. You think that could fool a
Corleone?
CARLO
Mike, I'm innocent. I swear on the kids,
Mike. Please, Mike, don't do this to me.
MICHAEL
(as he pulls up his own
chair)
Sit down.
CARLO
(sitting)
Mike, don't do this to me, please...
MICHAEL
Barzini's dead. So is Phillip Tattaglia,
Moe Greene, Strachi, Cuneo. Today I settle
all Family business, so don't tell me
you're innocent, Carlo. Admit what you
did.
(to Neri)
Get him a drink.
(to Carlo, as Michael shifts
in his chair)
Come on. Don't be afraid, Carlo. Come on,
you think I'd make my sister a widow? I'm
Godfather to your son, Carlo.
(after Neri hands Carlo a
glass of wine)
Go ahead, drink it...drink
(after Carlo drinks)
No Carlo you're out of the Family
business, that's your punishment. You're
finished. I'm putting you on a plane to
Vegas.
(to Tom, as he reaches out
his hand)
Tom?
(more)
120
MICHAEL (Cont'd)
(after Tom hands Michael a
plane ticket, which he hands
to Carlo)
I want you to stay there. Understand?
(quietly, after Carlo nods
and hmmms)
Only don't tell me you're innocent.
Because it insults my intelligence and
makes me very angry...
(then)
Now who approached you? Tattaglia or
Barzini?
CARLO
(after hesitating)
It was Barzini
MICHAEL
Good.
(after standing)
There's a car waiting for you outside to
take you to the airport. I'll call your
wife, to tell her what flight you're on.
CARLO
(as he rises, starts to
protest)
Mike, please...
MICHAEL
Come on. Get outta my sight.
Carlo turns. Rocco helps him put on his coat.

Michael, Neri and Hagen emerge as Rocco locks the door.
CUT TO:
INT. CAR – DAY
Clemenza garrotes Carlo, who gets pulled back and kicks his feet
at the windshield, which breaks as the car takes off. Michael,
Tom, and Rocco watch. After the car pulls away, we hear the Title
Theme music as they walk through the mall.
DISSOLVE TO:
THE CORLEONE MALL
Moving men load a truck labeled "John J. Bartek Moving." We see a
sign on the wall that says "Future Commercial Development - Genco
Land Co. – 5.6 Acres" with a small "sold" sign underneath it. A
limousine drives through the gate stopping besides the moving
truck. Connie gets out, arguing with her mother who's seated in
the car.
CONNIE
(yelling from car)
Whattaya tryin' to tell me!
MAMA
(yelling from car)
Look I'm trying to tell you you're wrong!
CONNIE
(yelling, while getting out
of the car)
Aw Mama, please!
(running into the house
crying)
Michael! Michael!
KAY
What is it?
CONNIE
Where is he? Michael!
Connie and Kay run out. Connie opens the door to the Don's office.
Michael's sitting at his desk with Neri behind him. Kay follows
122
CONNIE
Michael! You lousy bastard you killed my
husband! You waited until Papa died so
nobody could stop you, and then you killed
him. You blamed him for Sonny. You always
did. Everybody did. But you never thought
about me. You never gave a damn about me.
Now what am I going to do?
KAY
Connie...
CONNIE
(to Kay, after Kay puts her
arms around her)
Why do you think he kept Carlo at the
mall? All the time he knew he was gonna
kill'im.
(to Michael)
And you stood Godfather to our baby you
lousy cold-hearted bastard. Want to know
how many men he had killed with Carlo?
Read the papers – read the papers!
(after she picks up and
slams down a newspaper)
That's your husband! That's your husband!
Connie goes toward Michael. Neri holds her back until Michael
motions it's okay.
MICHAEL
(taking Connie's arms as she
cries)
Come on...
CONNIE
(struggling out of Michael's
arms)
No! No! No!
MICHAEL
(to Neri)
Get her upstairs. Get her a doctor.
Neri takes Connie out of the room. Michael sighs, then lights a
cigarette.
MICHAEL
(to Kay)
She's hysterical. Hysterical.
KAY
Michael, is it true?
MICHAEL
Don't ask me about my business, Kay...
123
KAY
Is it true?
MICHAEL
Don't ask me about my business...
KAY
No.
MICHAEL
(as he slams his hand on the
desk)
Enough!
(then)
Alright. This one time Michael points his
finger...this one time I'll let you ask me
about my affairs...
KAY
(whispering)
Is it true? Is it?
MICHAEL
(quietly, shaking his head)
No.
KAY
(after a sigh of relief and
Michael kisses and hugs her)
I guess we both need a drink, huh?
Kay leaves the room to fix Michael a drink. At the same time,
Rocco, Clemenza, and Neri enter the office. Clemenza shakes
Michael's hand. Kay turns her head to watch them. They embrace
Michael, then kiss his hand.
CLEMENZA
(kissing Michael's hand)
Don Corleone...
Rocco kisses Michael's hand as Neri shuts the door blocking Kay's
view.
FADE OUT
THE END
