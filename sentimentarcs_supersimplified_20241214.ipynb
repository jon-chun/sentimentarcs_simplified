news-letter (monday-monday, 21-28 june, 1714): \\'we have received advice from turky that the rebels in asia9 had entirely defeated an army of forty thousand men, which was sent by the grand signior10 to reduce them to their obedience.11 the same letters add that the sophia of persia12 had granted his protection to ismael bachathe13 [sic, \\'bacha the\\'] chief promotter [sic] of the insurrection, and had sent him a supply of ammunition and forces, whereupon the ottoman port [sic] was making great preparations to subdue him, before he becomes more formidable. \\' 1.3 \\'hague, october 2 [1716],\\' the boston news-letter (monday-monday, 7-14 january, 1717): \\'we are curious to know how the russian monarch14 will resent the inhuman murder of his ambassador by the tartars. the czar sent him, with a numerous retinue, laden with presents of the riches of his country, to the sophi of persia,15 in expectation of the return of the like presents from persia:16 but the tartars, thro\\' whose country the ambassador was travelling, cut both him and his retinue in pieces, and made booty of whatever they had. \\'17 1.4 \\'vienna, jan. 8,\\' the boston news-letter (monday-monday, 2-9 march, 1719): \\'they pretend here [vienna] to have advice, that the king of persia18 will declare war against the ottomans and has invited the czar19 to enter into an alliance with him against the porte,20 but this seems too uncertain to be depended upon.\\'21 1.5 \\'ispahan in persia, june 30,\\' the boston news-letter (thursday-monday, 9-13 june, 1720): \\'notwithstanding the rebel mervabis22 is not yet reduced to the obedience of the sophi,23 the hostilities occasioned by this rebellion in this kingdom are very inconsiderable.\\'24 1.6 \\'london, june 3,\\' the boston news-letter (monday-monday, 18-25 september, 1721): \\'they write from ispahan, the capital of persia, that the king25 who is at present at machor26 with his army consisting of between 50 and 60000 men, has had the good fortune to defeat the rebels that were risen in arms against him, to drive them up into the mountains, and to relieve the towns they had besieged.27 he has besides discovered a conspiracy against his person and government, formed in favour of those rebels by his chief minister of state,28 who had his eyes put out, and was afterwards beheaded; an execution without example in this country on the person of so great a man.\\'29 1.7 \\'ispahan , the capital of persia, march 26,\\' the boston news-letter (monday-monday, 6-13 november, 1721): \\'it appears by a conspiracy discovered in january 1720, that our prime vizier30 had formed a design to dethrone the king or sophy;31 but he was quickly apprehended with his principal accomplices: his eyes are put out, but his life is spared till his great riches are discovered. in one chest has been found 400,000 persian ducats, besides foreign coyn, and in another place abundance of jewels, gold and silver. several great persons concerned in the plot, had amassed large treasures to enable them to compass their aim.\\' 1.8 \\'foreign affairs. ispahan, march 6,\\' the new-england courant (thursday-thursday, 4-11 december, 1721): \\'the conspiracy form\\'d by the grand vizir32 last january this twelvemonth, with design to make himself king of persia, was seasonably discover\\'d, and himself and accomplices secured; since which the state hath enjoy\\'d its former tranquility, and a new vizir is appointed33 in his room, the old one\\'s eyes being both put out, he is kept alive (but in prison) to make him discover all his riches; which must be immensely great, since they found in one of his chests four hundred thousand persian ducats, beside foreign coin, and in another place abundance of jewels, gold and silver; and so in proportion among several of his accomplices; by the help of which treasure they hoped to compass their ends.\\'34 1.9 \\'dantzick, april 29,\\' the boston gazette (monday-monday, 23-30 july, 1722): \\'we have advice from moscow, that the czar35 continues there, but that he has resolved upon an expedition towards the caspian sea,36 and will go himself to command in person the chief body of forces to be employed in it. the troops already marching for this service, are 15000 regular foot, and 800 dragoons, under general allart:37 they will be transported by sea; in order to which a number of vessels is fitting out at casan38 and astracan with all diligence, to be commanded by admiral apraxin:39 the czar will go with them.40 they are to land at shirwan, a province in persia, and to make themselves masters of derbant, and chamachy the capital;41 whereby they will secure the passages, and open an easy way to chilan,42 another province, which by its situation and inclosure of mountains is almost separated from the rest of persia. at the same time another body of 40000 men, to consist of 10000 cossacks from the don, 10000 from the ukraine, 10000 calmucks,43 and 10000 baskiers44 and other tartars,45 is to march from astracan by land to attack the usbecks on the other side; by which the czar proposes to gain almost all the caspian sea.46 he thinks to finish this campaign in four months, and then to return to moscow.\\' 1.10 \\'moscow, april 3,\\' the boston news-letter (monday-monday, 30 july-6 august, 1722): \\'his czarish majesty47 is now busy in inspecting the affairs and management of all his vast dominions, and how to contrive effectual measures for making himself master of all the harbours near the caspian sea,48 thereby to extend our commerce to persia: \\'tis thought his czarish majesty, will go in person for that end to casan, and perhaps to astracan. capt. waerd, who has published a map of all the places situated hard by the caspian sea, is preparing to go thither.\\'49 1.11 \\'pekin, the capital of china, jan. 12,\\' the american weekly mercury (thursday-thursday, 30 august-6 september, 1722) and \\'constantinople, feb. 29,\\' the boston news-letter (monday-monday, 15-22 october, 1722, third paragraph beginning \\'a persian ambassador...\\'): \\'we return to moscow, to make some observations on the designs of the czar50 along the coast of the caspian sea. it is certain, according to the accounts of the most famous travellers, that several rivers on that side, as well as in the other parts of the world, have some gold dust mixed with their sand,51 but it does not follow from thence that there are mines of that precious metal along those rivers... .perhaps the czar will be more successful: but whatever it be, i believe he has a more rational project in view; which is, in my opinion, to secure such ports along the caspian sea, as may induce the persians to come into a treaty with him, to take no european commodities from any other nation but his own, and to sell their silks and other merchandizes only to the russians, who continue resolved to open a communication between the caspian sea and the baltick, by means of the canals they have made,52 and are making in several places, to transport by water all sorts of goods from the wolga to petersburg... .the prince designs to command that expedition in person, and hopes to meet with no great opposition; though it is very probable, his neighbours will take umbrage at his designs. they write from constantinople, that the persian ambassador53 has made some overtures relating thereto, and that the turks grow so jealous of his projects, that they have proposed to the persian minister a treaty of commerce, which chiefly tends to procure a prohibition of trade between the persians and moscovy... . we have advice from constantinople, that a persian ambassador is arrived there, and has had his publick audiences:54 his business is, to return the compliments made by the turkish ambassador sent lately to persia, on the circumcision of the grand seignior\\'s son,55 and to cultivate a good understanding between the two empires, especially at this juncture when there is a rebellion in persia. the persians are the more complaisant to the turks at this time, lest the grand seignior should give succour to the chief of the rebels in persia,56 on account of his being of the mahometan sect.57 the porte has received advice, that this rebel has sacked a city called schamachia,58 situate on the caspian sea and belonging to the king of persia,59 where was the chief settlement of the moscovites who trade into persia, and that he has not only plunder\\'d the moscovite merchants of their effects to the value of 100000 l. sterling,60 but he has also put about 200 of them to the sword.61 the moscovite resident62 having complained of this hostility to the porte, the vizier63 has answered, that he was no subject nor friend of the grand seignior\\'s, and that the porte had nothing to do with him. \\' (fig. 1.2) fig. 1.2damad ibrahim pasha, nevsehirli. portrait by jean baptiste vanmour c. 1727-1730. oil on canvas. rijksmuseum, cc0 1.0 universal 1.12 \\'constantinople, may 24,\\' the new-england courant (monday-monday, 10-17 september, 1722): \\'several expresses from the frontiers of persia have brought advice, that the ringleaders of the rebels, meriveis64 and schiech mahmud,65 being supported by the great mogul,66 had effected a general revolution in that kingdom. the former, who hath the greater interest, hath not only made himself master of the country between candahar and ispahan,67 but hath also obtained a complete victory over the sophi of persia\\'s68 army,69 and laid siege to that capital, the castle whereof he hath taken,70 and put the city under contributions.71 this meriveis is the more formidable, in regard his army is almost entirely made up of voluntiers, to whom he gives the plunder of all the towns through which he passes, without sparing either christians or turks. scheich mahmud hath also made a considerable progress, having reduced all the country from dagistan to the province of erivan.72 the sophi himself had much ado to escape, with only 3 or 4 of his courtiers.73 he is retired to our [turkish] frontiers, and hath demanded succours of the porte; but we cannot learn what success he is like to meet with.\\'74 1.13 \\'vienna, june 13,\\' the boston news-letter (monday-monday, 10-17 september, 1722): \\'they write from constantinople...that a great insurrection in persia was carried on by two malecontents, assisted by the great mogul,75 their forces consisting chiefly in voluntiers who are allowed to pillage wherever they come; one of the leaders of those revolters had totally defeated the troops of the sophy,76 who narrowly escaped with only four courtiers to the frontiers of turkey,77 and soon after the rebels took the town and castle of ispahan, the capital of that country, and had extended their conquests in a formidable manner.\\' 1.14 \\'vienna, july 22,\\' the boston gazette (monday-monday, 17-24 september, 1722): \\'different reports are spread relating to the czars78 expedition in persia; some say that his fleet has obtained a compleat victory over the rebels near derbent; but others give out, that the persians have routed the czar\\'s fleet, and taken 20 of his ships:79 \\'tis likewise reported, that the persians, in conjunction with the chinese, and other neighbouring people, are drawn together in a body to the number of 500,000

that prince advice, that the sophi of persia82 having fled to the frontiers, was seized there by the troops of meriveis, who immediately caused the eyes of both of them to be put out,83 and that the

of meri-weys and the rebels of ubeck [sic, uzbek], who plundered the caravans of the muscovite merchants. these motions have obliged the porte to send orders to the governours of babylon91 and other frontier provinces, to raise and exercise their militia, and a great number of cannon, mortars, bombs, grenadoes, powder, and other warlike stores are putting on board several ships here, to be transported to the said frontiers thro\\' the black sea, and trebisond. \\' 1.17 \\'constantinople, june 5,\\' the american weekly mercury (thursday-thursday, 11-18 october, 1722): \\'\\'tis reported

having sent an officer to meriveys99 (who has since usurped the kingdom of persia) to complain of his men having plundered several of his caravans coming from china, that rebel instead of giving him the satisfaction he expected, used the officer very ill, upon which his czarish majesty was resolved to take suitable measures for avenging this affront; and they tell us, that to this the visier answered, that his czarish majesty might do just what he thought fit. they compute this loss of the moscovites at above 5 million of rix dollars.\\'100 1.18 \\'london, august 2,\\' the american weekly

tartars of usbeck, on account of the injuries which his subjects have suffered by them; that the sophi of persia109 had concluded an alliance with the czar, by virtue of which the latter was engaged to re-establish the former upon the throne of persia, who in return is to yield up to him the whole province of georgia, and some of the most considerable ports of the caspian sea; that this project might easily be put in execution, and that as soon as his czarish majesty should have received advice, of his troops having made a descent upon the coasts of persia, he would send them new orders to

was possess\\'d by the persian rebels, and whose governour had formerly been a subject of the porte\\'s, but went over to the sophi\\'s129 party, and now sided with the rebels. the sultan130 has

the russian minister residing at constantinople,132 that the porte will not suffer it; and immediately after a bassa was sent with a considerable number of ottoman troops, with a proportionable train

that means establish a commerce with the great mogul;136 and that if he fails in this, he will endeavour to conquer some strong harbours on the west side of the caspian sea, to which he claims a right... . they write from constantinople, that the last advices they have received from the bashaw,137 who commands the turks forces in the camp near susa,138 inform them, that hitherto he could not make himself master of that place, by reason that the rebel garrison was very numerous, but having already began to bombard it, he hoped to be master of it in a short time,139 after which he would besiege erkaten.140 the town of susa was formerly the metropolis of persia, as it still is of chusistan,141 and is situated upon the river tiritiri,142 or charon,143 about 60 leagues towards the east of bagdad. the same bashaw adds, that the towns of servan144 and derbent, upon the caspian sea, having refused to submit themselves to the rebels, their chief, miriweis, had ravaged their two places, and put all the inhabitants to the sword whom he found under arms. this leader being informed, that the czar145 designed to make himself master of the river dosia,146 he had sent a numerous army that way, with express orders to guard all the passes to, and the formidable places of that river, and to repulse whoever should offer to come forwards. \\'tis reported, that the sophi of persia is now at bagdad,147 and that he has promised the sultan148 great advantages, in case he would assist him in regaining his throne: to which they add, that his highness intends to go incognito, and meet him upon the frontiers of that kingdom.\\'149 1.31 \\'hambourgh, septem. 8,\\' the american weekly mercury (thursday-tuesday, 29 november-11 december, 1722): \\'this day a report was spread upon \\'change, that there had been a violent battle lately fought in georgia, between the forces of the czar150 and the persians, or tartars, commanded by meriweis, and that the latter had the advantage over the russians; but this merits confirmation: for the muscovite minister151 who resides here [hamburg] has as yet received no account of it.\\'152 1.32 \\'tauris in persia, may 12,\\' the boston news-letter (monday-monday, 31 december, 1722-7 january, 1723): \\'one of our distressed king\\'s153 sons154 having assembled an army in april last, within two miles of ispahan, the capital town of this country, attacked and overthrew the forces commanded by the grand rebel meryweis, who retired with the remainder of his troops to a place called hazadara,155 or thousand hills, which is a stony ground, without wood, water or any provisions, so that they will soon be obliged to surrender at discretion, being surrounded on all sides.\\' 1.33 \\'constantinople, may 12, 1722,\\' the boston news-letter (monday-monday, 31 december, 1722-7 january, 1723): \\'the disorders that have lately broke out in persia, are now come to such a head, that they endager the subversion of that empire: for, besides the prosperous success of that rebel who sacked schamachia,156 there is another insurrection headed by the imam or prince of mascar,157 who is said to have made himself master of several of the southern provinces and to be marching towards bandar abassi or gumroom, the chief trading city on the bay of ormus;158 a third, and the most dangerous insurrection, is headed by one mirveiz, other wise called the prince of candahar, because his father, who was governour of that province, which is on the frontiers of the mogul\\'s country,159 made himself sovereign of it, and was succeeded in it by this his son; who, not contenting himself with that principality, marched last year to the city of cherman,160 famous for the finest manufacture of persian silks,161 and not only subdued, but also plundered that city, and the whole province. incouraged by this success, he has lately marched, with extreme difficulty, to ispahan the capital city, and had like to have surprized the king there, who had but just time to save himself in a neighbouring castle,162 where \\'tis thought he cannot hold out a week, if he continue there, though some advices say he is fled from thence with a retinue of 200 persons. this prince of candahar having thus made himself master of ispahan, not only plundered all the persians there of the sect of hali, but as the advices say, has raised contributions upon the frank merchants, under pretence of a loan to pay his troops with, and with a promise of repaying them as soon as he is able. he is a mussulman of the sect of mahomet, as all these rebels are, in opposition to the persians, who are generally followers of hali, and deemed hereticks by the others:163 he declares every where, as he goes, that he does not pretend to the crown, but only to bring the king over to the true religion, and that whenever his prince will renounce his heresy, and embrace the true mahometan faith, he will lay down his arms, and pay due obedience to him. this pretence has been so successful to him, that people flock to him from all parts of the kingdom. these advices the port received a few days ago from their pashas of erzeroom and babylon, on the confines of persia, who represented at the same time, the ease with which the grand signior might make himself master of several of the provinces of that kingdom, in this time of so general a confusion; upon which the grand signior164 assembled a general council, according to the usual practice whenever a resolution about peace or war is to be taken, wherein these advices were offered to their consideration, and proposals were made by some of the pashas, for taking advantage of this favourable conjuncture, to conquer some of the persian provinces, and put a stop to the success of the rebels, though they were of the mahometan sect; and this seemed to be the prevailing opinion, till the grand vizier165 spoke, who told them the grand signior judged it was neither just nor honourable to take advantage of the difficulties the king of persia, his good friend was under, whose kingdom had not yet recovered itself of the blow given it by his great grandfather sultan selim,166 but that he thought a considerable number of troops and warlike stores of all sorts should be sent to those confines, and orders given to the several pashas to take under their protection and treat kindly such of the persian provinces as should have recourse to them for it; and that if the king himself should fly to them for refuge, they should receive him with all due honour as the grand signior\\'s guest; that if he should be so successful as to get the better of the rebels, and reascend his throne, all his provinces which might have recourse to the protection of the port, should then be restored to him, as was formerly practiced in a like case, in relation to the provinces of schirvan, iran, ghilan , and the great city of tauris, and that the pashas should be very attentive to the motions of these rebels, and regularly inform this court of what pased. agreeably to the vizier\\'s speech, the great council took its resolution.\\'167 1.34 \\'constantinople, sept. 2 [1722],\\' the boston gazette (monday-monday, 20-27 january 1723): \\'the ambassadors of meriweys are gone home with joyful hearts, to tell their master that the grand seignior168 has ordered his troops to be in a

crossed the caspian sea, they arrived the 17th of august at the port of agraham,173 12 leagues on this side terki, a town belonging to the czar in the province of daguestan,174 to which place the czar marched immediately with the army, and was received with great demonstrations of joy by all the inhabitants, who made him rich presents;175 and having rested there two days, he continued his march towards derbent, accompanied by the czarina176 and all her retinue. during the two days his majesty staid at terki, brigadier vetteran177 was detached with 2000 dragoons and cossacks to advance towards andreoff,178 a place in the province of daguestan179; and the inhabitants refusing to submit to the czar\\'s troops, he attacked & routed them, and took about 5000 men prisoners; after which the place surrendered.180 we daily expect an account of the czar\\'s arrival at derbent, which is not above three or four days journey from terki, and situated in the province of schirvan in persia:

quarter\\'d in the city of jutpha,181 and kept all the gates shut, to hinder the inhabitants from retiring elsewhere, and that he treats them as ill as he had done those of ispahan.182 they add, that another chief of the rebels named lagflick,183 had possess\\'d himself of the town of artevel,184 situate near the caspian sea.\\' 1.38 \\'vienna, oct. 21,\\' the new-england courant (monday-monday,

within reach to observe them, had not dared to venture a battel, having besides certain advice, that the persian rebels were abandoning meriveis, and inclined to replace the sophi,188 or one of his sons, on the throne.\\' 1.40 \\'extract of a letter from derbent,\\' the boston news-letter (thursday-thursday, 21-28 february, 1723): \\'the czar189 having ordered part of his army to march to

residence, consisting of 500 houses, which were burnt with some other places. several of their prisoners have been broke upon the wheel, and 800 were killed.191 they write from petersburgh, that our emperour found at derbent 232 brass cannon.192 the king of persia brought his imperial majesty the keys of the town of chamagni193 and desired his protection against the tartars and rebels. his imperial majesty went some miles from derbent to see the pits which were made in the reign of alexander the great.194 on the other hand, some letters say, that the sultan195 being not pleased with the czar\\'s proceedings, had ordered a numerous army to march against him. letters from moscow say, that the czar has sent detachments to take possession of the towns of mordou196 and samache,197 and

bashaws to assemble their forces, and to hold them in readiness to move upon the execution of some design which they should in a little time be acquainted with.200 the rebel miriweis has sent a letter to the sultan, by which he recommends himself to his highness,201 and endeavours to the sultan, in which he recommends himself to the good graces of his highness, and justifies his conduct; the sophi202 he has described like a second nero,203 and pretends that the prince his eldest son204 is of the same barbarous and cruel temper. to this he adds, that the grandees of the kingdom having opposed the settling of the succession upon that prince, and having declared that they were ready to sacrifice their lives and fortunes in the service of his younger brother,205 the sophi had put several of them to death, that this had occasioned a general discontent and made \\'em resolve to dethrone the sophi, and to make his youngest son regent of the kingdom. he concludes his letter with beseeching the grand signior not to look upon him as a rebel, but as the protector of the kingdom, and that of the young prince, flattering himself that his highness will assist him in the execution of his just designs. we impatiently long to know which side the porte will take on this occasion, especially seeing that the sophi is retired from the frontiers of turkey, to go and meet the czar.\\'206 1.42 \\'hague, feb. 23,\\' the new-england courant (monday-monday, 22-29 april, 1723): \\'a persian merchant who has lived a long time in holland,207 and is look\\'d upon as the best oracle of news brought from his country, pretends to certain intelligence that the old sophi,208 or king of persia, is protected by the porte,209 and that he has a prospect of subduing the rebels before they make a farther progress in the dominions of persia.\\' 1.43 \\'vienna, feb. 10,\\' the new-england courant (monday-monday, 22-29 april, 1723): \\'we have received letters from constantinople, dated the 5th of january, which take notice, that the report spread there about the end of november last, that the army of the rebels in persia dwindled away, and would not be able to take ispahan, had proved false, or else that their army had been strongly reinforced; for the beginning of january an express arrived at constantinople from the bassaw of van,210 upon the confines of persia, with advice, that miriweys, the chief of the rebels, had at last taken ispahan upon capitulation with the inhabitants, and had put the king to death, with as many of his sons as he could lay hands on, beside several of his ministers and great officers; after which he declared himself king, by the name of sciach mahomet, and created a new sett of officers both civil and military, appointing for his chief vizier one ismud devlet,211 who held that post under the late king, but was deposed, and had his eyes put out, under suspicion of holding correspondence with this meriweys.212 on the other side, those advices add, that the son of the late king,213 who was viceroy or cham214 at casbin,215 hearing of his father\\'s death216 and the loss of ispahan, had declared himself king, and was acknowledged as such in his government;217 but had hitherto got but a small army to support his title. the porte had not yet receiv\\'d the confirmation of this news from any other bassaw on the confines; however, the truth of it was not at all question\\'d at constantinople.\\' 1.44 \\'alexandretta in syria, sept. 7,\\' the boston news-letter (thursday-thursday, 9-16 may, 1723): \\'the grand signior218 has sent a man of war hither219 laden with all kinds of provisions & ammunition, with orders to transport \\'em to babylon and other places of turkey,220 upon the frontiers of persia; from whence they write, that the rebel meriveis still continued with his army at julfa, a suburb of ispahan, whose inhabitants as yet defend themselves against that rebel.\\' 1.45 \\'constantinople, octob. 11,\\' the boston news-letter (thursday-thursday, 9-16 may, 1723): \\'the porte taking great umbrage at the czar\\'s221 expedition in persia, has resolved immediately to d atch an aga in the character of envoy extraordinary, to ingage his imperial majesty to desist from the execution of his great design,222 and \\'tis thought the grand signior223 will take no measures in the present juncture till he has receiv\\'d an answer from the czar. we are inform\\'d that both the sophi\\'s sons224 use their best indeavours to get possession of their father\\'s throne, and are perpetually caballing against each other; \\'tis believ\\'d they will apply to the porte for assistance against meriweis, who on the other hand has already apply\\'d, promising that he will make the persians embrace the mahometan religion.225 it may not be improper to inform our readers that the turks look upon the persians as schismaticks;226 they differ in several points, but chiefly concerning one hall, aly, or mortis aly, who, according to the turks, was mahomet\\'s fifth successor, but according to the persians his immediate one, and several amongst the latter look upon him as equal to mahomet himself.\\' 1.46 \\'constantinople, octob. 12,\\' the boston news-letter (thursday-thursday, 9-16 may, 1723): \\'by our last advices from persia, we are inform\\'d that the rebel meriweis was still incamp\\'d with his whole army in the suburbs of ispahan, and that the sophi227 had substituted one of his sons to reign provisionally in his stead,228 by which means the minds of the people, who are incens\\'d against him, might gradually be appeas\\'d. this has already produc\\'d so very good an effect, that the substituted prince has agreed upon a truce with meriweis, on condition of the former\\'s paying him a large sum of money every year; and they flatter themselves that he will obtain by negotiation what he never could have gained by force of arms. the cham of tartary has sent word to the porte, that the emperor of russia229 having landed his army near terki, had made himself master of derbent, and some other places upon the caspian sea, as well as of teflis, the metropolis of xarduel230 in georgia. to this he adds, that he very much fear\\'d that this monarch would in the end make himself master of georgia or gurgistan. this country is bounded on the north by circassia, on the south by turcomania, on the east by serivan, and the tartars of caghestan, and on the west by the black sea. mount caucasus divides this country into two parts. the eastern, which is the ancient iberia, and gurgistania propria, is tributary to the persians, and is divided into two kingdoms, those of xarduel and zsgathai.231 the western part, which is tributary to the turks, comprehends the kingdom of imitetta,232 in which is contain\\'d samsea,233 the kingdom of guriel and mingrelia. the people of georgia profess the faith of the greek church. upon these advices the

and deposed him, telling the people they should acknowledge him as their king for the future: having made this declaration he retired, and according to the intelligence the aforementioned basha of

the czar379 the towns of terki,380 derbent, and andreof,381 with the other small places of daghestan, which his czarish majesty took last year. and they add a report, as if the emperor of china had sent an ambassador to miriweys, to promise him a considerable body of forces.\\'382 1.88 \\'constantinople, (the metropolis of turky) august 6,\\' the boston news-letter (thursday-thursday, 16-23 january 1724): \\'the ottoman army which was drawn together at erzerum, being augmented to 80000 men,383 and having presented it self before tifflis, (the capital of georgia) the persian governour immediately deliver\\'d the keys of the fortress to the seraskier,384 who found scarce any resistance during his march. all the inhabitants of that city submitted to the porte, except the prince,385 who retired with his whole retinue towards mingrelia; but some troops have been detach\\'d to pursue and seize him. after the conquest of tifflis, the ottoman army was divided into two bodies, one of which was ordered to penetrate into the remotest parts of georgia,386 and the other has made it self master of the city of erivan: the governour of that place, who offer\\'d to make resistance, was beheaded.387 the seraskier has sent advice to the grand vizier,388 that this is the most favourable conjuncture for making an entire conquest of persia, and for obliging the russians to abandon that country; and he promises to possess himself of the city of ispahan, in case he can be supported by the bassaw of babylon389 at the head of another body of troops. it seems that the porte is disposed to enter into these measures.\\' 1.89 \\'constantinople, aug. 10,\\' the boston news-letter (thursday-thursday, 16-23 january 1724): \\'our advices of the progress of the ottoman army on the side of georgia and persia are confirmed. the grand seignior390 receiv\\'d lately a letter from meri-weys, in which that usurper acknowledges him as chief of the mussulmans, and invites him to join his forces against the common enemies of the law of mahomet.391 this proposal has the approbation of the divan, the lawyers, and especially of the mufti:392 but it is strenuously opposed by the grand vizier.\\'393 1.90 \\'foreign affairs. from the london journal october 12,\\' the american weekly mercury (tuesday-tuesday, 21-28 january 1724): \\'great rejoycings have been lately made at the russian court, on account of an express being arrived there from derbent with advice, that the czar\\'s394 troops had taken by storm the town of bacha,395 situate on the caspian sea, about 60 miles s.e. of schamachia,396 having a very good harbour. but should the turks join forces with meriweys, which looks very likely, their joy may soon be revers\\'d. the persian ambassador at moscow397 earnestly presses that court for assistance, to place the sophi398 his master on the persian throne, who is the last of the royal family, the rebel meriweys having caused the rest of his royal brethren to be strangled. that young prince still continues at tauris, where he is daily raising forces to oppose the progress of the usurper, who is said to have used the european merchants at isaphan [sic] with the utmost barbarity.\" 1.91 \\'constantinople, (the metropolis of turky) april 24,\\' the boston news-letter (thursday-thursday, 30 january-6 february 1724): \\'the ambassadour who is lately come hither from miri-weys has presented the grand vizier399 with a sabre set with pearl and diamonds to the value of 20000 crowns: he distributed also very rich presents to the other ministers of the porte. this sabre was formerly worn by the sophi abbus,400 was found among the treasure of the late dethorned [sic, dethroned] sophi,401 as were likewise the rest of the presents.\\'402 1.92 \\'petersburg, (in russia,) april 26,\\' the boston news-letter (thursday-thursday, 30 january-6 february, 1724): \\'the express, who brought the account of the submission of the whole province of ghilan,403 which is the best in persia, brought also advice that a great number of rebels have forsaken miriweys and declar\\'d for our emperor.404 \\'tis talked that the eldest son of the sophy,405 who retir\\'d to ardebil, sends hither an ambassador406 to implore the protection of his imperial majesty.\\' 1.93 \\'warsaw sep. 17,\\' the american weekly mercury (tuesday-tuesday, 4-11 february, 1724): \\'they write from constantinople, that the turks have made great progress in georgia,407 and on the borders of persia, without meeting with any resistance, upon which they flatter themselves with the hope of being soon in a condition, not only to possess themselves of ispahan, the capital of persia, but also to oblige the russians to abandon their new conquests, along the banks of the caspian sea. the same advices say, the port has caused it to be intimated to the resident of russia,408 that the emperor409 his master, must withdraw his troops from that country, and that if he should refuse doing it, the grand signior410 would be obliged to brake the peace concluded between the two empires.\\' 1.94 \\'constantinople sep. 12,\\' the american weekly mercury (tuesday-tuesday, 4-11 february, 1724): \\'the grand signior411 has order\\'d his troops that are marching towards the persian frontiers, to encamp near the army of meriweys, in oder to be ready to join and support it against the muscovites, in case they persist to extent their conquests in persia.412 the ambassy of several persons of distinction,413 having notice of this order, took their audience of leave of the grand vizier414 on the 28th past, and yesterday set out on their return home. they had some time ago presented to the grand vizier 36 russian prisoners who were immediately claimed by the czar\\'s resident415 here, but to no purpose, as yet; he has obtain\\'d leave only to send to them every week an allowance of money for their subsistance.\\'416 1.95 \\'moscow, (the capital of russia,) april 27,\\' the boston news-letter (thursday-thursday, 6-13 february 1724): \\'the news from persia concerning the defeat of several thousand muscovites is confirmed on all hands. the governour of andreof417 writes, that he has grounds to believe the late expedition by the persian rebels was made by the instigation of the ottoman porte, which maintains an underhand correspondence with miri-weys, in order to dislodge our people from the new-conquer\\'d places, at least to render the possession of them difficult, without discovering themselves to be the first breakers of the peace between the czar418 and grand signior.419 the governour adds, that the turks have lately entered persia,420 with an army of 50000 men, expecting certain persian princes would join them according to their promises; but those considering further of the matter, advised the turks to retreat; that the bashaw was accordingly withdrawn, perceiving the superiority of the persians, but had wrote to constantinople, desiring a reinforcement of 50000 men more, in order to begin their military projects successfully.\" 1.96 \\'petersburg, (in russia) april 30,\\' the boston news-letter (thursday-thursday, 6-13 february, 1724): \\'it is said, the last express from constantinople has brought advice, that the porte bestows its utmost attention to the affairs of persia, especially since miri-weys shews so much zeal, either pretended or real, in propagating the mahometan religion, which himself has embraced: he goes from camp to camp, from city to city, with the alcoran, missionary like, making publick declaration that mahomet is the true holy prophet, that his doctrine alone ought to be followed: and considering the great progress these methods have made among people of all ranks, the porte does not care to meddle with a prince armed with a pretence so specious as that of religion, and distinguished by the character of propagator of the mahometan law. on the other hand, the porte is apprehensive, that when miri-weys has thoroughly subdued the persian kingdom, he will afterwards disturb the ottoman dominions; this is the more likely, because of the present sophi\\'s421 unfitness for war; yet, should the porte restore the old one, his fidelity is greatly liable to suspicion upon account of former misdeeds against the ottoman interest.\\' 1.97 \\'petersburg, (a city in muscovy) sept. 28,\\' the american weekly mercury (tuesday-tuesday, 25 february-3 march, 1724): \\'the 6th instant being the birth day of the princess nathalia, the czar\\'s daughter,422 there was a numerous court in the garden, to which all the foreign ministers likewise repaired. the persian ambassador,423 after having taken a turn in the walks, and observed every thing that was most curious, made his honours to the czar as he sate by a grotto; and then he was conducted to the czarina,424 who was sitting near a fountain: after having taken off his slippers, and made three low bows he moved on his knees to kiss the hem of her majesty\\'s garment; and then, after having taken a few steps backward, he made the following compliment, i have cause to thank god for giving me the favour to see your imperial majesty and to congratulate you on the birth day of the princess your daughter. then the empress, by the mouth of her great chancellor,425 enquir\\'d after his health; to which the ambassador answered by a compliment of thanks, and retired after making three more bows. we are assured, that meriweis caused the eyes of the old sophi to be put out, and the throats of the young sophi\\'s brothers to be cut; and that the young sophi426 would have had the same fate, if his father,427 finding himself and family in the usurper\\'s clutches, had not contrived his escape, that there might be one of his family left alive to succeed him... . the taking of the town of bacha428 by our troops is a conquest of greater importance than it appeared at first; for besides that its harbour is the best in all the caspian sea, it covers derbent from all insults, and is capable of laying the whole province of schirwan, which is of a large extent, under contribution.\\' 1.98 \\'petersburg, (a city in muscovy) sept. 21 [1723],\\' the american weekly mercury (friday-thursday, 12-19 march 1724): \\'they still pay all possible honours to the persian

between this crown and the sophi,430 his master, who is the last of that family. private letters from the frontiers of persia say, that meriweis has had some gold and silver species coin\\'d, on one side representing meriweis, with this inscription, meriweis, protector of the persian monarchy; and on the reverse two slaves, close shaved, without ears or noses, and over them a naked hand with a simiter [sic, scimitar], with these words, vindicta de hostibus.431 a great deal of this money has been dispers\\'d thro\\' georgia, particularly in the towns we have conquer\\'d. this usurper\\'s

news-letter (thursday-friday, 19-27 march, 1724): \\'on the 10th instant the porte received two expresses from ibrahim bashaw, governour of erzerum, advising, that the georgians of carduel , who were tributaries formerly to the dethroned sophi, and submitted afterwards to the czar at his expedition to the caspian sea, have thrown themselves under protection of the grand signior at the approach of 8000 turks commanded by the said governour of erzerum , who has already got possession of the city of teflis, capital of georgia, and of two other places. it is said he was helped in this expedition by the prince of rivan,433 whose country borders upon georgia. \\'tis reported that the russians have made themselves masters of the schirvan, as well as of all the coast of the caspian sea as far as the gulph of ghilan.\\' 1.100 \\'constantinopole, (the metropolis of turky,) july 25 [1723],\\' the boston news-letter (friday-thursday, 27 march-2 april, 1724): \\'we have received certain advice from the pasha of erzerom , who is seraskier in those parts,434 that he having drawn together a body of troops, pursuant to an order from the port, had advanced to teflis, and possessed himself not only of that place, but of the whole province of georgia, and its dependencies, without opposition. upon the arrival of this advice here, it was declared that the port had taken possession of that country, both because the people had demanded their protection, and because they found it necessary for the security of their empire. we are in expectation to hear of the further progress of the pasha of erzerom, who it is said has orders to continue his march into schirvan, erivan, and other frontier provinces of persia, lying convenient for the port; which provinces he will probably subdue without drawing sword: it is also said, that orders are sent to the pasha of bagdat435 to advance towards ispahan with another body of troops.\\'436 1.101 \\'hamburgh (a strong city in germany) octob. 1,\\' the boston news-letter (friday-thursday, 27 march-2 april 1724): \\'a certain minister has received advices from persia, that miri weys has ordered a medal to be struck, one side of which represents his busto or effigie, with the following legend: wiri-weys protector monarchia persia. on the reverse are two slaves, having their heads shaved, and their nose and ears cut off, over whom is a hand holding forth a sabre, with this inscription, vindicta de hostibus: this medal miri-weys has caused to be dispersed into georgia, and in all the czar\\'s437 conquered places. those advices add, that miri-wey\\'s credit and interest increases daily throughout persia, since the inhabitants meet with milder treatment from him. the embassy sent by him to constantinople receives from the porte unusual honours and respects; so that it is no longer doubted but the alliance between him and the grand signior438 is fully concluded.\\' 1.102 \\'petersburg, (a city in muscovy) oct. 27

to the bad news, that ibrahim bassa, governor of wan,458 who commanded an army of 60000 men, has been defeated by 80000 persians, on the frontiers of georgia, some miles above erivan. this is certain, that upon the return of the express, who came some days ago with the muscovite emperor\\'s answer to the proposals of the porte, about quiting his conquests on the borders of persia, the muscovite

to keep all that is situated between the mountains of caucasus, the coasts of the caspian sea, with derbent, baku, ghilan, mascan ran,532 and ferebas,533 even to the river ossa or oxus, where begins

towards the caspian sea, taking in the city of casbin. the kan of the tartars is also to be ready for a march on the side of russia. our freshest advices about merweis are, that he has declared himself king and prophet; and that he is always attended by two grand equeries dress\\'d all over in white. this enthusiast, who has engross\\'d immense riches, has given a prodigious shock to the loyalty and constancy of the people of asia; and, it seems, that the janizaries in hassan basha\\'s army had rather be employ\\'d against the russians than against the mussulmen.\\' 1.136 \\'foreign

1.137 \\'foreign affairs. from the london journal, may 16,\\' the american weekly mercury (thursday-thursday, 20-27 august, 1724): \\'the court at moscow seems to think, that the state of their

\\'affairs have again taken a new turn since my last. the grand vizier,538 whose interest it is to maintain the continuation of peace on the side of europe, having found means to bribe the mufty,539 called the divan together two days ago, and engaged them likewise to approve his views; so that they unanimously resolved, that since the emperour of russia540 still persists in his intention, not to attack the ottoman empire directly, and declares he will not do any thing in persia, contrary to the interest of the porte, it is not permitted by the maxims of the law of mahomet to attack him, or declare open war against him. that therefore it was proper to declare a-new to that monarch, that the ottoman porte will not attack him on the side of europe, but that if he should take in persia, the least step against the interest of the porte, the sultan541 will take it for an open rupture, and oppose him with numerous armies; this is the expedient the grand vizier has found means to get accepted by the porte, whereby he will be enabled to continue near the person of the grand seignior, as he always endeavours to do, the better to defeat the cabals of some who aim at thrusting him out of his eminent post.\\' 1.139 \\'foreign affairs. vienna, may 14,\\' the new-england courant (monday-monday, 24-31 august, 1724): \\'by letters from constantinople, of the 19th of last month, we have

successfully into persia towards tauris:544 he had taken care to provide the places of strength in georgia against the enterprizes of the last chan or governour,545 who still keeps together a body of

obliged to retreat, with the loss of the territories of teflis, as also a great number of men, and abundance of stores.\\' 1.141 \\'foreign affairs. from the london journal, may 23,\\' the american

built near baku, to hinder the muscovite transports from astracan to derbent; and that the general opinion was, that the turks encourage, under hand, that design; which is the more likely since the latter are continually under various pretences, shuffling off the signing of the treaty of peace with the czar,548 which intrigues very much puzzle the russian court.\\' 1.142 \\'hamburg, (in germany) feb. 8,\\' the boston news-letter (thursday-thursday, 17-24 september 1724): \\'they write from petersburg, that a courier from constantinople brought the aggreeable news to the court, that the

conquer\\'d from the turks by the persians, shall be restored to the porte, and that the young sophy shall content himself with old persia. that moreover, his russian majesty will not extend his

the muscovites, from pushing their conquests farther. \\' 1.145 \\'hamburg, june 23,\\' the american weekly mercury (thursday-thursday, 24 september-1 october, 1724): \\'letters from moscow say, that court is preparing to return to petersburg; and advices they receive from persia, are kept very secret, \\'tis whisper\\'d however, that if the russian emperor556 insists upon imposing hard terms upon meriweis, the latter will absolutely refuse coming to any agreement, and that notwithstanding the fair overtures made to him, on that head, by the porte, he does not seem inclined in the least to truckle to the emperor, having good grounds for relying more and more on the assistance of the great mogul557 who has already sent him 40000 men, insomuch, that the army of this usurper will shortly consist of 160000 men.\\' 1.146 \\'warsaw, (a populous city in poland,) march 18,\\' the boston news-letter (thursday-thursday, 31 october-6 november, 1724): \\'tis said that the czar\\'s minister558 here [warsaw] has received advice, that the great mogul559 has declared that he is willing to observe an exact neutrality with respect to the affairs of persia; and that the ottoman porte has resolved to come to no rupture with his czarish majesty. some advices from constantinople say they have a project on foot for dividing the kingdom of persia between the new sophi,560 the grand seignior,561 and the czar;562 but this needs confirmation.\\' 1.147 \\'hamburg, (one of the chief cities in germany,) march 31,\\' the boston news-letter (thursday-thursday, 19-26 november, 1724): \\'the last advice

succours he pleases, in order to re-establish him upon the throne of his ancestors; and after his being put in possession of that throne the grand signior596 is to acknowledge him for king, and in the mean time his highness to esteem meriweys as an usurper, however, without being obliged to furnish any troops against him, which last article is owing to the mufti,597 because of his being of the

contented himself to keep possession of the conquests made already in persia by the czar\\'s599 arms, and to put the fortresses into a good posture of defence against any surprizes from the enemy,

the porte and the czar600 his master: he was assisted by the marquis de bonac, ambassador of france, who by his mediation manag\\'d and brought this affair to a happy conclusion. \\'tis certain, that by this treaty of accomodation, meriweis has no wrong done him, since to his principality there is added a territory of the kingdom of persia, and he is acknowledged for a sovereign prince by the porte and by the czar, without which the grand seignior601 would not condescend to conclude this treaty of accomodation; and besides this, he is to retain the government of the kingdom of persia,

themselves one whole day, and did not surrender \\'till after they were almost all of them cut in pieces, as was likewise the most part of the inhabitants.606 this victory was immediately made known to the people by several discharges of the cannon, and at the same time an order was published throughout the city, enjoining all the inhabitants to adorn and illuminate their houses and shops, and make publick rejoicings for seven days successively. the grand vizer607 sent also to notify this news to the foreign ministers, inviting them to pertake of the said rejoycings, and to adorn and

whereof is to be allotted, to the usurper meriweys--other letters from thence mention a report, that the command of the turkish troops in persia has been conferred on the said meriweys.615 the latest letters from constantinople notify the arrival of an express there, with advice that the city of erivan in persia, had at last surrendered to the ottoman forces; who had closely blocked it up for three months,616 in which time 37000 men perished by the sword or famine; the remainder, amounting to 35000, being removed from thence with their effects.\\' 1.161 \\'boston, april 15,\\' the boston

kingdom, and made a speech to this effect: faithful & worthy partakers of the burden of the regency, it cannot but be fresh in your memory, how long mars has display\\'d his standard in persia, how much blood spilt, what havack & devastations he has caused amongst us, which our posterity will feel for a long time to come: tis high time to sheath the sword, seeing the grand seignior our faithful ally, proposes an accomodation for me & the kingdom of persia, whereby all differences with the czar621 of muscovy may be friendly adjusted, and in my opinion the states ought to take it into consideration, that the kingdom formerly flourishing, may recover its losses. i doubt not but my courage & measures entered for settling the monarchy, will meet with general approbation. whereupon the whole assembly cry\\'d out, long live meriweis , and desired him to return the grand seignior their thanks. 1.163 \\'constantinople, january 8,\\' the american weekly mercury (thursday-thursday, 13-20 may, 1725): \\'according to our last advices from persia, the 8000 men sent by the porte to reinforce our army on that side were safely arrived; and they expected the like number to follow very speedily. the famous miriweys continues in that kingdom, at the head of a numerous army, which is daily increased by the auxillaries he receives from asia, and the deputies he sent to the great mogul622 found means to inveigle many people of that country into miriweys\\'s service. it is true, these men are armed only with bows and arrows, and are altogether strangers to discipline; but on the other hand, they are exceeding numerous, and so much the fitter to ravage a large country, as no doubt they will, having been bred up to thieving and robbery. that usurper, it seems, disperses manifestoes where-ever he comes, charging the grand signior623 point blank with breach of faith, and with a design to annex the kingdom of persia to his own empire.\\' 1.164 \\'moscow, jan. 20,\\' the

were assembled from different provinces of asia, in order to pass the mountains together, and join miriweys, who had already a prodigious army under him. mean while, that usurper had given assurances to the governour of derbent,626 that he shall not undertake any thing against the countries subdued by the czar,627 provided his russian majesty will remain neuter.\\' 1.165 \\'london, february 20,\\'

here is in substance what has been publish\\'d at constantinople, concerning the situation of their affairs in persia. the seraskier, who commands the troops,648 designed for the siege of tauris, has subdued the small cities of merend,649 sansent650 and jolvan,651 another body of ottoman troops has also reduced eight fortified country towns, inhabited by armenian christians, who were all made

but he dispatched immediately colonel tscheratow658 with 1000 men to encounter the said vizier, who overtook him upon his march in the night, and attacked him so briskly, that after a fight of three hours, the enemy was obliged to make his escape, after having left behind him a great number of dead and wounded; and though in the pursuit many more of them were cut to pieces, yet their loss cannot be exactly computed, because those barbarians are accustomed to carry off their dead even in the midst of the fight. our troops have taken a great quantity of arms and other warlike munition, with abundance of horses and mules.\\' 1.177 \\'constantinople, june 26,\\' the boston news-letter (thursday-thursday, 25 november-2 december, 1725): \\'the russian emperor\\'s659 death has occasined [sic]

enemies to the russians: they commit great devastations, among others, in the province of chirvan, where the limits were to be settled between the porte and russia,660 whereupon the grand signior661

tartars. our ambassadour at constantinople671 has not as yet been able to prevail with the porte to send commissioners for settling the limits in persia, which makes it suspected that the turks do not act sincerely with us.\\' 1.181 \\'constantinople, (in turkey,) july 9,\\' the boston news-letter (thursday-thursday, 9-16 december, 1725): \\'the following particulars are publish\\'d here relating

february, 1726): \\'on the 12th instant [august] the porte receiv\\'d advice, that on the 21st of last month [july] the persians, to the number of about 100000 men attacked the turkish army before tauris, and fought them all day with doubtless success, but that in the evening they were forced to retire into the city, the turks following them. tauris has no fortifications,675 but is divided into eight large streets676 at every one of which the persians had made ditches with ramparts behind them;677 these they defended so obstinately, that tho\\' the turks attacked with great bravery they fought almost hand to hand into the town three days and four nights, in which time the turks having taken six of those ramparts sword in hand, the persians surrendered the other two, and consequently the city, at discretion.678 there must needs have been a great deal of blood spilt in so long a fight between so numerous armies; and \\'tis given out here, that of the persians about 80000 were actually slain, and about 25000 turks.\\'679 this great victory was obtained by the seraskier abdullah who is pasha of van, and of the famous family of the kiupruli\\'s.680 it is said, that prince tochmas seb the late king of persia\\'s son, headed the persians in this battle the first day, but withdrew the second, being wounded; and that it is not yet known what is become of him. since the news of this battle came, the port has also received advice, that the seraskier mustapha pasha,681 who commands another army towards ghencia ,682 has taken a fortress called lori683 near that rich city, and it is not doubted but he will take the city itself; after which he is to march into the province of schirvan, whose inhabitants are all of the mahometan sect. it is reported, that mirveiz having been murthered by some of his officers at the instigation of his nephew eschreff, the latter has since been murthered likewise;684 and that those people whom they call the avogans,685 are so lessened by their divisions, that the port has thoughts of marching their army to ispahan, in order to drive them quite away, and settle the kingdom of persia upon such a foot as may best suit their interest. upon this great news publick rejoicings were made here for five days, and a firework was let off; to which rejoycings all the christian ambassadours were invited. \\' 1.183 \\'moscow, (in

trade is ascribed to the intreagues of miriweys. the expresses between this city [moscow] & astracan continue to pass frequently; and \\'tis said that miriweys, with his formidable forces, to the number of 150,000 men, among which there are 40000 circassian troops, is drawing near the frontiers of georgia, and seem to be big with an enterprize.\\' 1.184 \\'constantinople, august 5,\\' the

his ancesters [sic], his party does only grow stronger every day, but he also gains now and then considerable advantages over the troops of esref,691 his new competitor, whereby he opens himself the way to ispahan, this encourages the persians to side with him, insomuch, that \\'tis not unlikely esref will have as bad a fate as his kinsman meriweis. the new aspect of affairs in those parts does in some measure puzzle the porte, however, they have sent fresh orders to abdula bassaw692 to reduce tauris as soon as possible, cost what it will, which will doubtless prove a very difficult task, because \\'tis expected the garrison and inhabitants will defend themselves to the last extremity.\\' 1.185 \\'hague, september 25,\\' the american weekly mercury (tuesday-tuesday, 4-11 january, 1726): \"letters of august 5, from constantinople say, the porte has received an express from the bashaw of babylon,693 who forms the blockade of tauris in persia, with advice, that meriweis falling sick of a fever at ispahan,694 his cousin-german695 esref took the opportunity to poyson him,696 to be revenged for the death of his father, whom he murther\\'d, because he had usurped the principality of camdahar697 from meriwey\\'s father: that esref thereupon gave it out, that he died a natural death,698 and afterwards caused himself to be proclaim\\'d sophi in his stead; which done, he went out to meet prince thamas, son of the old sophi,699 then on the march, with a small army towards ispahan, which engaged and beat esref, but made a halt because of 3000 men just come into his assistance. that the young sophi likewise expected a great reinforcement, upon whose arrival he intended to march on to ispahan:700 that the persians who were for the deceased meriweys seem\\'d resolv\\'d to espouse the interest of the young sophi; and that it was very probable, that the fate of the second usurper wou\\'d be the same with that of the first. \\' 1.186 \\'warsaw, (in poland,)

to death, to be revenged for the murder of his father,705 and was thereupon proclaimed sophi. that about the same time the young sophy tachma, marched towards ispahan with 15000 men to dislodge the rebels from that capital; and that meriweis, who was then alive, commanded 7000 men to oppose him, which arriving near comheyvan,706 a little town in the mountains betwixt ispahan and casbin, were attacked and intirely defeated by the sophi tachma; about which time the rebel meryweis was put to death. that afterwards cherecphana commanding the same number of men against sophi tachma, was defeated;707 but rallying all the troops he could muster, he marched at the head of \\'em two leagues out of the town of ispahan, where he was so well posted that he hoped to triumph over his enemy, who at his approach made a halt, so that a battle was expected.\\' 1.189 \\'constantinople, sept. 1,\\' the boston gazette (monday-monday, 17-24 january, 1726): \\'towards the close of july last, we

that prince tahmar [sic, tahmasp] was marching from tauris to ispahan, he drew near to the former of those places, from which he was distant but 5 days march. upon his approach, about 80,000 persians came out of tauris, to give him battle, and attack\\'d him with so much vigour, that for a while it look\\'d as if they would have gained a compleat victory; but fortune afterward going over to the turks, they defeated the persians, & went with them pell-mell into the town, where the inhabitants still defended themselves four hours, disputing the ground inch by inch. the loss of the turks is computed at about 10,000 men kill\\'d, and as many wounded; and that of the persians is magnify\\'d to 200,000. since the conquest of tauris, which was formerly the capital of persia, and is still the

august 12,\\' the american weekly mercury (sunday, 30 november, 1721): \\'the captain of a french ship arrived at leghorn, whose name is guerin, and who is come in 30 days from smyrna,721 reports, that tauris, the great city of the persian empire in asia, not far from the borders of turkey and the caspian sea, formerly the metropolis of the persian empire, and the residence of their kings,722 which is now removed from thence to ispahan, was on the 26th of april last entirely swallowed up by an earthquake, together with above 240,000 souls.\\' 1.196 \\'london, sept. 10,\\' the new-england courant (thursday, 18 december, 1721): \\'we hear from ispahan, that the destruction of the city of tauris by an earthquake (on the 21st of april last) was however attended with one good circumstance; to wit, that the villages round about it felt nothing of the earthquake: and \\'tis even reported, that the church of the armenians, wherein almost a thousand christians were assembled, did not partake in the ruins of the city, but was miraculously preserv\\'d. our countryman, sir john chardin, who was upon the spot not many years ago, says, this city has suffered much by earthquakes formerly, and that one of them being foretold by a learned astrologer in the year 849,723 a great many of the inhabitants removed, but 40000 who did not believe him staid, and were destroyed in the ruins at the exact time when he predicted. the city was by the same astrologer\\'s advice rebuilt, and the foundation laid when the sun was in scorpio, and he told them they should have no more earthquakes, which they say, has \\'till now been exactly verify\\'d.724 sir john makes it the 2d city in persia for grandeur, trade, and the number of inhabitants, which he computed at about 5,75000 [sic].725 he reckon\\'d 15000 houses, and as many shops standing in the middle of the city, separate from their dwellings. he commends their exchanges for their extent, beauty and riches; and says there were about 300 inns, some of them large enough to lodge as many people, and no less than 250 mosques, some of them very magnificent.726 there was the largest piazza here, or square that he ever saw, in which he says 30000 men have been drawn up together in order of battle.727 \\'tis a market for provisions &c. in the day, and the people resort to it in the evening, to see gaming, wrestling, bull and ram-fighting, and the dancing of wolves, which last the citizens so much delight in, that they give 500 crowns apiece for such as are well trained.728 sir john adds, that this city was frequented by merchants from all parts of asia, and had magazines of all sorts of commodities, the most valuable of which are sold in their exchanges, and that they have great manufactures of cotton, gold and silk, of which they used to work up 6000 bales a year, for they had then a trade all over persia and turkey, with muscovy, tartary, india, and the black sea. tavernier says, there\\'s more money here than any where else in asia, there being rich armenian merchants,729 & abundance of artificers in iron work: and that most of the shagreen-skins730 that come from persia are dressed at this place. there\\'s hardly a city in the world whose origine and first name have been more disputed, so that we shall say no more of either than that historians are generally agreed it is one of the most ancient cities in the world.\\'731 portuguese assistance for the persians against the omanis 1.197 \\'from the london daily journal, sept. 15 [1721],\\' the american weekly mercury (tuesday-tuesday, 6-13 february, 1722): \\'we have advice from lisbon, that they are informed by letters from goa, which are confirmed by others since, that in compliance to the league offensive and defensive, made some years ago between the king of persia732 and the portugueze,733 count don lewis de menezes d\\'ericeira, viceroy of the east indies,734 had sent a squadron of ships to the assistance of the persian king against the arabians,735 who were the common enemies of that prince and of the portugueze, commanded by don lopo d\\'almeida, who died just at his arrival upon the coasts of persia. these letters add, that don antonio de figuercido urra,736 who had been appointed admiral in his stead, had fought three sea-combats with the arabians,737 and every time came off completely conqueror.738 in one of these fights he sunk the admiral, a ship of eighty guns, and so shattered two more of their largest ships, that they were no longer in a condition to serve. he had also slain 1400 of their best men.739 and these losses had so discouraged the arabians, that the king of persia had in a very little time driven them out of the frontiers of his kingdom, which they had entered by land. by the same advice we hear farther, that the portugueze admiral was returned into the port of goa, with a great sum of money which the king of persia had given him, as well to reward his services, as to pay certain rights, which that prince had for a long time refused to pay the portugueze.\\'740 2.1 \\'petersbourgh, (in russia,) aug 14,\\' the boston news-letter (thursday-thursday, 3-10 february, 1726):

lead,3 830 other iron bullets, 7 brass cannon bullets each a pound weight, and some hundred of horses and mules. on our side there was but very little loss. on the 12th, the empress4 with her august

grand seignior shall acknowledge as lawful the marriage of sultan esreff with the dethron\\'d sophy of persia\\'s daughter, as well as the son he has already by that marriage. 4. that the ottoman

8. that the grand seignior should grant an amnesty or pardon to sultan dely110 and his tartars, who had declared for sultan esreff. 9. that the ottoman porte and sultan esreff should forthwith name

throughout the empire, and countermanded the march of their forces into persia, that the turks have lost since the beginning of that war 15000 men, and almost exhausted the treasure; that sultan esreff was much beloved by the persians, as well for his excellent qualities, as on account of his marriage with the dethron\\'d sophy\\'s daughter, by whom he has a prince. 2.39 \\'london, march

sending the proper orders, this incident had made no flaw in the peace. thus esreff had secured himself against any further disturbance from the turks, but yet was said to be in a very uncertain state, being hated by the persians, and having lost his chief support, which is his own country of candahar, a brother of the late mireweis having made himself master of that province, 146 by which

weekly mercury (thursday-thursday, 5-12 october, 1727): \\'seeing our news-paper affords no remarkable occurences, we have chose here to insert, (which \\'tis hoped will not be unacceptable to our readers,) a very curious, but faithful and particular relation of that war, which lately laid all persia, desolate, and entirely overthrew the government of one of the greatest and most flourishing monarchies of asia. taken from the political mercury for february 1726-7.221 the persians, who are almost all mehometans, are divided into two sects, the one follows the alchoran according to the explanation and commentaries of hali, whom they call the coadjutor, or the lieutenant of god; and the other obeys the doctrine of omar. the first are those who are properly called persians and in this sect are the king, the princes and most of the nobility of the kingdom: the second are called aghues or aghuans, and this sect never made any considerable progress except in the provinces of candahar, korestan,222 sizistan and kirman; yet are they always declared enemies to the persians, by whom they are often ill treated, and therefore are continually wishing for an opportunity to revolt and to shake off their yoak; this was their case now they wanted only a person of a firm heart, and a cool unverstanding, to conduct and support them in any enterprize. they had not been long in this search before they found what they wanted, in the person of mahmoud the son of mirveis, and one of their own sect. this man, tho\\' born among the lowest of the people, had a most ambitious soul, he had meditated several years, under the pretext of supporting the rights and privileges of his religion, a design of making himself independent in the province of candahar , and of seizing the throne, if fortune would second his attempts; therefore he gladly made use of this disposition of the aghues ,223 and began to assemble a considerable number of troops in the mountains, and to secure his success, in this prodigious undertaking, he made an attempt to bring over the guebres, or what they call the old persians,224 who are always reckoned very valiant, and the best soldiers in the kingdom. this succeeded to his witness, and mahmoud now finding himself supported by these people, to the number of about ten thousand, he join\\'d them to the body of his aghues who now consisted of about 15,000 men more and with this army in the beginning of january 1722, he invested kirman , the capital of the province of that name; this town did not hold out long, whether they did not expect so sudden an attack, or that they saw so large an army of guebres before them, or that they found among themselves a great number of that sect which obliged them to surrender the town to the enemy; however it was, the place made mahmoud master of the province of kirman; gave great encouragement to his army, and caused him to form a resolution of marching directly to ispahan the capital of the whole kingdom. he began his march at the head of 40,000 men, leaving only one thousand to garrison the town; he found no opposition in his route, his army increased daily by great numbers of fugitives who joined it; the people every where affrighted, leaving their towns and villages to avoid the spoil of an enemy. two men only, mirguam rostum 225 brother of the prince of georgia, and commander of the persian cavalry, and alimerdan kan , prince of larristan ,226 voluntarily stopped his march; they advanced towards the rebel with about 4 or 5000 chosen men; they attacked him warmly, but when they had gain\\'d some little advantage, finding themselves surrounded by the enemy, they were obliged to save their lives by flight, with a few of their followers, who had with difficulty escaped the fury of the enemy. seven thousand men or thereabouts were slain in this action on both sides, but the greatest loss fell upon the rebels. after this, mahmoud continued his march towards ispahan , this city was in the last consternation, unprovided of troops, ammunition or provisions, and not knowing in any manner to make opposition to a formidable enemy, from whom they could expect no quarter. the king was likewise struck with horror, his armies being dispersed in the different provinces of his kingdom, he saw it was utterly impracticable to draw them together in any time, he was obliged to inroll immediately among the citizens forty thousand men, he divided them into two bodies, the command of one he gave the prince havouza called vali,227 and the other to iktimadoulet, his first minister.228 the two generals marched out of the city, at the head of their troops to give battle to the enemy which came nearer to ispahan every day, on the 8th of march 1722. the two armies met, and halted before one another within four leagues of this city; neither of them cared for the onset, and while they survey\\'d each other without any action, confused and distant shouts were heard from both armies, and several small arms here and there discharged to no purpose: when about nine in the evening the prince de havouza advanced to the attack; the action was sharp, and in very little time he laid every thing before him that was in his way: and notwithstanding all the precautions that mahmoud had taken to fortify his camp, the prince forced it sabre in hand, and made himself master of all the treasurers of the enemies camp, this dazled his eyes rather than animated his courage, and employing his thoughts rather how he shou\\'d preserve the wealth, than pursue the enemy, and compleat his victory, he shamefully retired into the city, satisfy\\'d with the plunder of the day. but this avarice cost persia very dear, for the enemy perceiving his retreat, took possession again of their camp, killed the persians, they found there, and pursued the main army so warmly, that they came up with their rear-guard, attack\\'d them, and retook all the baggage and the treasure, and brought it back with them to their camp. this defeat of prince havouza, animated the spirits of the rebels, and waken\\'d those of the body commanded by iktimadoulet; this general, who had fought very bravely, and likewise had advantage of the enemy, finding it was out of his power, by reason of the flight of the other general, to resist any longer, resolved to make an honourable retreat, and to incamp himself advantageously under the walls of the city, and where he [could not easily be attack\\'d; this he did, but he was vigorously pursu\\'d, and with very great loss].229\\' 2.72 \\'the continuation of the history of the late revolution in persia,\\' the american weekly mercury (thursday-thursday, 12-19 october, 1727): \\'the news of this defeat,230 in which more than 15000 persians, perished,231 besides the loss of their baggage, and 25 pieces of cannon,232 soon spread all over ispahan , and spread with it such a terror, over the inhabitants, and the king himself, that if the rebels had followed their blow, they might immediately have been in possession of the city, and the king: but mahmoud , who cou\\'d hardly credit his own happiness, and fearful of an ambush, contented himself to advance slowly; and stopped here and there, to pillage the riches of the grandees of persia, as he found them on his march in their country-houses round the city. but when the spies that he had sent into the city, reported the disorders they found there, he repented his delay, but too late; however, without amusing himself any longer, with hunting after plunder, which must be his at last if he succeeded, he marched at the head of his army, and incamped on the 19th of march, at zulpha ,233 a great and populace town, inhabited by armenians, about a league from ispahan , of which he was master without difficulty, the inhabitants immediately submitting to a man whom they knew they cou\\'d not resist with impunity. from hence he detached a body of 10000 men,234 to endeavour to enter the city, and take it by surprise, and followed himself with the main army: that if the first succeeded, they might be ready to sustain them, but this had no success, the negligence of mahmoud in not pursuing his victory, and taking the advantage which lay before him, was looked upon by the people of ispahan , as the effect of excessive fear, which had seized the hearts of the rebels, and gave them hopes of defeating an enemy, at whose first approach they trembled. they fortified the city in the best manner they cou\\'d in their circumstances, and posted their best troops in the most advantageous manner: their cares were not useless for the 10000235 men sent by mahmoud to attack them, were repulsed vigorously, and with loss, so that not only they, but the army which supported them, were obliged to retreat with precipitation. the general of the rebels, who reflected with uneasiness on the opportunity which his negligence had given to the citizens, to recover their courage, and to fortify their town was determined to give them no longer time, and resolved to march with his whole army, which now consisted of one hundred thousand men, and make a general storm. this resolution was to have been executed on the 22d of march 1722, but the little river zendera ,236 upon the banks of which the city of ispahan is situate, swell\\'d this day so high, that the enemy durst not undertake to ford it. they waited till the 23d, when the waters subsided, and lest the passage of it not dangerous. the aghuanis began the attack, under the command of jacques curland ,237 otherwise known by the name of charron.238 this christian, when he had some time before heard of the success of mahmoud , with whom he always held intelligence; quitted his employments, and joined the rebel at the head of a good number of aghuanis. the storm was made with great vigour, every thing gave way before them, and the whole army had that day certainly enter\\'d the city, if the aghuanis upon the first advantage, believing themselves intirely masters of the place, had not dispers\\'d themselves, and ran about without any order, from one part of the city to the other, shouting and discharging their pieces continually; when a body of persians, taking advantage of their want of discipline charged them in close order, and warmly, and after a little resistance, obliged them to retire. this first attack being unsuccessful, the rebel had no stomach as yet to attempt a second; they were too late witnesses of the vigorous defence of the besieged, not to be very sensible how much another assault would cost, thus having changed their revolution they now thought only of turning the siege into a blockade; in order to which, they resolv\\'d to seize all the passages by which any provision or succours might enter; that so they might reduce it by famine, tho\\' they could not take it by force; but this was not so easy to execute. the city of ispahan is indisputably one of the greatest in the world, it is about thirty english miles in circuit, without reckoning very large suburbs, and well fortify\\'d: it is true, it is not people in proportion to its bigness; for besides the publick buildings, which are in great number, and of great extent, the house of every common tradesman has a hansome court-yard before it, and a large and magnificent garden behind it planted with trees; so that when you look from the risings before it upon the city, it appears to the traveller like a great and wide forrest intermixt with buildings. the army of the rebel, thought numerous, was not sufficient without venturing the loss of it, to be divided into so many bodies as would be necessary to guard every avenue to the city, to form a perfect blockade: nor durst they seize them for fear of a defeat, and weakening too much the main body. mahmoud therefore resolved to keep himself quiet in his intrenchments, which were upon the river between zulpha and ispahan , and to undertake nothing until he had received a considerable reinforcement, which he expected from the provinces of candahar , sizestan , and kirman ; however, from time to time he was continually making attempts, and endeavouring to render himself master of some advantageous posts, that might facilitate his enterprize. the months of march and april were both thus wasted in little useless skirmishes on both sides. the king of persia sensible that the design of mahmoud was to reduce the city by famine, consider\\'d seriously of the best means to prevent this misery: in order to succeed, he resolved to solicite the grandees and the people, to endeavour to collect their whole strength at once, and to make a salley with one hundred thousand men, and force the enemies intrenchments, or at least to oblige them to incamp, with more respect, at a greater distance: he propos\\'d his design to iktamadoulet and to the prince havouza : the first was intirely of the kings opinion, and the other of an opinion quite contrary: the prince havouza, who occasioned by his avarice (as we have said before) the loss of the first battle, fearing, not without reason, if the king, should be successful he might be disgraced, was now in the interest of mahmoud, and endeavoured as secretly and with as much art as he could, to prevent every thing that might be prejudicial to the rebel: the king who really had a value for the prince, for his valour, and skill in military affairs, and who had no manner of suspicion of his infidelity, came over unfortunately to his opinion, and gave directions that no sally should be made without special orders from the general vali, to whom he had intrusted the government of the city: this order of the king\\'s surprised and afflicted all the inhabitants, and shew\\'d at the same time, how well disposed they were to have attacked their enemies: but they received a little consolation on the departure of prince tamas, son of the king of persia: this prince was endued with all the virtues, necessary to a hero, he was well-natured, affable, generous magnanimous, and wanted nothing but a crown worthy of him; he was presumptive heir, and declared by the king his successor, and acknowledged as such by the princes of the blood and the grandees of the court. he went out of town on the 1st of april, accompany\\'d only by four hundred chosen men. his design was to gather together in the provinces as many men as he possibly could, and to march with them to succour the city. no body doubted but the presence of so amiable a prince wou\\'d draw many to his party, and that the affection they had for him wou\\'d make them use their best endeavours to put him into a condition to oppose his enemies. but what a foundation is the fidelity of man! princes, as well as other men, while they are in prosperity, behold around them a crowd of courtiers, pressing all to give proofs of inviolable attachments to their persons; but when the cloud of adversity darkens this sun-shine, they are gone, the best friends in appearance are fled, and leave them victims to their misfortunes. \\' 2.73 \\'the continuation of the history of the late revolution in persia,\\' the american weekly mercury (thursday-thursday, 19-26 october 1727): \\'of this the young prince whom i have mention\\'d, was a terrible example. the melancholly condition to which he was reduc\\'d, without present succours, made little impression on the minds of his subjects. the provinces nearest to ispahan being struck with a pannick, upon the news they had received of the defeat of the persians, had quitted their houses, and were scatter\\'d here and there among the mountains, and neither cou\\'d, nor were willing to be reunited. and others who were at a greater distance, under the pretence of their frontiers on the turkish side, excused themselves from appearing; and the rest of the governours of provinces fancying this was a proper occasion to gratify their ambition, thought of nothing but making themselves absolute and independent: thus this unfortunate prince beholding himself forsaken by every body, and not having, by reason of these disorders in the kingdom, sufficient authority to make himself obey\\'d, resolv\\'d to return to ispahan , and defend the city the best he could, with the succour of the inhabitants and strangers, who had taken refuge there in great numbers: but then it was too late to return, the city being intirely invested, and every avenue possessed by the enemy. when mahmoud was apprised of the departure and design of prince tamas, he easily imagin\\'d what he had to fear upon the return of that prince, and was resolved if possible, not to be attack\\'d; he had but two ways, either wholly to abandon his enterprize and retire, or to press on the siege with so much vigour, as to oblige the city to capitulate before any succours could arrive: the first way did not relish at all, he was too far advanced to go back, and yet the other appear\\'d extremely dangerous; the resolutions which he knew the besieged had taken, to hold out to the last extremity, gave him greeat apprehensions for his army, which he cou\\'d not think of weakening under these circumstances: however, under the necessity he found himself either of conquering or perishing soon, it was out of all question that he must storm the city; and fortune in the destruction of ispahan , seconded his resolution. there was over the river at the extremity of the city a very wide bridge, at the foot of which stood a fort, which not only commanded the country, but some part of the city: if this fort were once taken, mahmoud might easily make himself master of the other forts successively, batter the town as much as he pleased, and cut off all manner of provisions. he consider\\'d therefore how to make himself master of this fort; an opportunity presented, and he made use of it. the georgians to whom the guard of the bridge and the fort was instrusted, having taken by accident some brandy which was going to mahmoud\\'s camp, drank so excessively, that they were quite gone, and left in their drunkenness, the fort utterly defenceless: mahmoud being advertiz\\'d of this by his spies sent immediately 1500 aghuanis, who on the last of april, seized on the bridge and castle, destroy\\'d the georgians, and turn\\'d the artillery against the city; this facilitated the passage of mahmoud\\'s army cross the river, where it was necessary for him to incamp, to take away from the persians, especially from iktemedoulet the advantageous posts of which they were possessed, and without which it woiuld have been very difficult to have taken the town. a reinforcement of twenty thousand men, which mahmoud, as has been said, expected from the provinces of candahar , sizistan and kirman came during this enterprize, but was not at all serviceable on the occasion: after having assigned to these troops the posts they were to guard in the intrenchments, which he had caused to be made in the beginning of the siege, between zulpha and ispahan ; he divided his army into two bodies, he caused them to ford the river at the extremities of the city, and in a little time saw himself master not only of the fortifications that defended ispahan , but of all the avenues by which provisions or succours cou\\'d possibly enter it. the besieged beholding their town thus blocked up on every side, without hope of any succour from prince tamas , whom they had learn\\'d was in a great deal of embarras himself, began a little to reflect on the miseries of the approaching famine, demanding earnestly that they might be permitted to sally and engage the foe; but the prince de havouza, who as we said was secretly in the interest of mahmoud, did all in his power to prevent it; telling them this was not a proper time, that he waited the command of the king; and that as soon as ever there was a favourable opportunity offer\\'d, he would not fail to advertise the king of it: this opportunity however was slow in coming; provisions began to fail, they diminished daily, and several of the people were already dead by famine: the nobles as well as the common people, were sensible how absolutely necessary it was to sally, and to open a passage whereby necessaries might be brought into the city: but the king, whose fear and indolence had shut him up in his palace, would give no ear to any instances; on the contrary, he seem\\'d to take offence, as if their petitions to save themselves by their arms, had been an insult upon his authority, and behaved towards his people in this distress, with imprudence and cruelty hard to be parallel\\'d. this unaccountable conduct of the king had certainly occasion\\'d a general insurrection in the city, if achmet aga,239 a man valiant and generous, and extreamly attach\\'d to the king, had not appeased the minds of the discontented, but putting himself at the head of the troops, to go forth immediately and give battle to the enemy. in the beginning of july this sally was made with about thirty thousand men, though they were sustained, but weakly, by the prince de havouza , they had all the success they cou\\'d hope for, they flew two thousand aghuanis, and obliged more to retire, they seized on several of the avenues, and opened passages for provisions to enter the city. this fortunate expedition gave great joy to the inhabitants, but it was not long liv\\'d; the prince de hazouza, who before only privately favoured the cause of mahmoud, now declared openly for him, and joining his forces with the enemy, they charged achmet aga in front, drove him from the posts he had taken, and put all the persians they found there to the sword, and pursued the rest so fast, that they could hardly save themselves in the city: this treason of the prince de havouza, and the defeat of achmet aga , damp\\'d at once the courage of the besieged, and took from them all hope of ever being reliev\\'d. the king of persia, more sensible than any of this misfortune, and not knowing, oppress\\'d with grief, what to undertake, order\\'d achmet aga to be call\\'d, and publickly blamed him for giving that easily into the desires of the people, he charged him with imprudence, and want of duty, in attacking the enemy\\'s intrenchments, without special orders; and said, the revolt of the prince de havouza, was occasioned by his rashness in putting himself at the head of the troops, when the general havouza might with reason believe himself injured, and his authority slighted. achmet aga said what he could in his defence, and endeavour\\'d to make the king sensible that necessity, the publick welfare, and the safety of his majesty\\'s person, were the sole motives that urged him to this enterprize. that as the prince de havouza he was known a long time to have kept a secret correspondence with the rebel. that the little desire he always shew\\'d to oppose him, and his great application to remove every thing that might check his victories, were evident proofs of his infidelity. but the king unwilling to hear achmet aga on that head, and the brave man uneasy at his master\\'s unjust reproaches, the next night, believing he cou\\'d no longer live with honour, swallow\\'d poison, of which he dy\\'d in three or four days.\\' 2.74 \\'the continuation of the history of the late revolution in persia,\\' the american weekly mercury (thursday-thursday, 26 october-2 november, 1727): \\'the loss of this great man, whose composition was justice, generosity and good nature, added to the general grief of the people, and the king too, who having too late corrected his prejudices against him, had resolved to entrust to him the care of defending the city, which had indeeded need of such a gouvernor, in the miserable situation to which she was now reduced by famine. nothing cou\\'d be more deplorable, than to see to what extremities human nature was reduced by want of food. imagin [sic] every thing painted by josephus, in the city of jerusalem, when besieged by titus vespasian,240 and behold all those horrors, i might add more, in the city of ispahan . the king who had but little experience in the art of war, and who gave in to [sic] easily to the opinions of people, not only unworthy of his confidence, but incapable of giving advice; had, in the beginning of the siege, published an edict, forbidding not only the citizens, but even strangers, to leave the city under any pretence: besides that whatever people fled thither, thro\\' fear of the enemy, as they came in crouds from the neighbouring villages, were all received into the city; so that there were within it, a multitude of useless mouths, and not only all the houses, but the court-yards, gardens, streets, and every publick building was full; yet notwithstanding this, and after the city was invested, and the avenues stopped, provisions were for a little time at an easy rate, but they soon became excessive dear. bread was sold in the month of july, at 9 or 10 piasters the pound (about 20 shillings english) in the month of august it rose to 30, in the month of september to 100, and in the month of october, when the city surrendered, it was at 200 piasters the pound. horseflesh, on which the king himself was obliged to feed, was 12 or 1500 piasters the pound, and cats and dogs were dainties, only to be eaten by a very few, and privately; in short, the misery became such, that at last, without horror or shame, the people nourished themselves with human flesh: and one might behold wretches, skeletons themselves, examining human carcases without flesh, of which the streets were full, to find a morsel to sustain the feeble remnant of their languishing lives, and which famine must soon make an end of: you might see others running thro\\' the streets with bars of iron, or other weapons in their hands, and destroying the first they cou\\'d meet, and greedily feeding upon them after: and mothers, insensible to the cries of the very infants they bore, massacre and eat them. nor was it only amongst the vulgar that these unnatural cruelties were used: people of the greatest distinction were obliged to come to the like extremities, some persons indeed of honour, chose to die by poison, and prevent their being reduced to these inhuman necessities. in this sad situation was the city of ispahan during two long months and a half: the number of the people who died was very great, the gardens and publick places were now all turned into cymiteries, and filled with dead bodies: and so many carcasses were thrown into the river, that in that year after the siege, no body could without horror thinking of eating any fish. if mahmoud had in this melancholly conjuncture thought of atacking [sic] the town, he must have taken it, and without much loss; but he, intent upon preserving the royal treasures, and those of the nobles for his own use, which would have been plunder\\'d by his soldiers in the heat of the action, kept himself still for near forty days, amusing the persians with vain capitulations; and yet assured as he was of the success of his enterprize, and though he expected every day that the city would surrender, he waited till the 23d of october 1722, when it was given up at discretion, and in this manner:\\' 2.75 \\'the continuation of the history of the late revolution in persia,\\' the american weekly mercury (thursday-thursday, 2-9 november, 1727): \\'at first the king, to soften the ferocity of the victor, and to secure his life, for which he was under the greatest apprehension, chose out among the princesses his daughters, one who by her beauty, her wit, and her engaging manners, he believ\\'d might prove most agreeable to mahmoud , (accompany\\'d with very rich presents) and, beseeching him humbly, and earnestly to accept her for his spouse: after which, throwing off every mark of royalty, and cloathing himself in black, he ran on foot thro\\' all the streets of the city with tears in his eyes, in the most supplicant humble manner, deploring his misery, and the ruin of his house, just now upon the point of being reduced to the lowest captivity. those few of the inhabitants who still remain\\'d alive in ispahan, touch\\'d with a spectacle so surprising and worthy of compassion, forgetting their own misery, were afflicted a new with the sight of their unhappy prince: after this melancholly and mournful ceremoney [sic], the prince put on his robes again, and placing the crown on his head, he march\\'d out of the city, accompany\\'d only with three hundred nobles of his court, and went directly to the camp of mahmoud. he endeavour\\'d all that was in his power, to make impression upon the rebel, but he cou\\'d not gain upon him at all. the haughty fierceness that glared upon his visage, made it plain, that he look\\'d upon his duty, as unworthy of a conqueror; and when the king enter\\'d his tent, he only rose from his sopha, and gave him the common salute, which he wou\\'d not have refused to the lowest person in his court. this insolent behaviour gave disgust to the rebels themselves and acherof, one of the leaders of the aghuanis, and a near relation to mahmoud, shew\\'d his indignation at it publickly. the king however, without discovering the resentment that prey\\'d upon his vitals, approach\\'d respectfully to mahmoud, and saluted him as if he had been his best and particular friend, acknowledg\\'d him for his son in-law, adopted him, and by a formal writing, made an authentick cession of his realms to him, and his descendants, excluding himself and his children which he then had, or should have for ever. and in return for so considerable a bounty, the king only desired two things might be granted to him; first, that his concubines might remain untouch\\'d and unseen; and, secondly, that he wou\\'d give him his own life, and the lives of his children, and the princes of the blood, whom he look\\'d upon as his brethren, and whom he had always found dutiful and affectionate to the utmost of his wishes: mahmoud gave him his conditions without hesitation, after which the king taking off his crown, placed it with his own hand on the head of mahmoud, presented him his sceptre, and at the same time deliver\\'d to him the keys, of his palace and his treasures, assuring him, that he wou\\'d from that moment always look upon him, and obey him, as his master, and lawful and only sovereign. the nobles of the realm, and the generals of the aghuanis and guebres, according to their kings example, made their proper submission: after which mahmoud according to the custom of the country, having given refreshments to the king of persia, and his followers, order\\'d forty thousand soldiers to march and take possession of the royal palace, and all the avenues and gates of the city, into which he made his publick entry on the 25th of the same month, in the following order [.?] jaquis courland preceded by 12 soldiers on foot began the procession, he was mounted on a horse richly caparison\\'d, he carryd the keys of the city, and the palace. he was followed by three hundred and fifty pretorian or life-guards marching two and two, with drawn sabres. these were followed by 30 offices [sic, officers] of the cavalry, richly cloathed and marching in a semicircle, at the head of whom rode the new king, the crown upon his head, and the sceptre in his hand, upon a horse of very great value, which prince havouza241 had presented him with some days before: on each side of him rode the two commanders in chief of his armies, kier soltan242 and amanulla,243 supporting a canopy, richly adorn\\'d and glittering with precious stones; the march was clos\\'d by one hundred more soldiers of the guard, as the first, sabre in hand.244 after which came the nobles of persia, having at their head some of the princes of the blood, and the newly dethroned king, who then took the name, and must, in the course of this history, be called for the future schah hussain. the streets which led to the palace, were lined with musquetiers, and at small distances perfumes were burnt to dissipate by their odours the noisom smell which the numerous carcasses of the people had left in the city. as soon as they arrived at the royal palace, mahmoud was conducted to a hall, in which there was a magnificent throne, and on which he placed himself, and was saluted a second time as king of persia, by schah hussai n, by the princes of the blood, and the nobles, who came in great numbers to court, when immediately they made a general discharge of the whole artillery of the city, which was answer\\'d by the forts and castles round it: there was nothing extraordinary in the publick rejoicing order\\'d in the city for several days, the misery for which the inhabitants were reduced, cou\\'d not at once permit them to shew too much joy at the success of the person who had occasion\\'d it. the scarcity however diminished daily, and bread which a few days before was sold at 200 crowns the pound, was now, by the order of mahmoud , sold at two: and soon after, provisions coming in abundance, every thing was it its usual reasonable price. the success of the new king, made him imagine every other enterprize wou\\'d now be easy: master as he was of the capital of persia, in possession of the king, the princes of the blood, and the nobles, he doubted not but the other cities and provinces of the realm wou\\'d acknowledge him, and surrender at once. so that after he had regulated his affairs in ispahan , and placed shah hussain , and his children under a strong guard, in the latter end of november, he ordered ten thousand aghuanis to casain , or casbin, a city which was formerly the capital of persia,245 and the ordinary seat of its kings, to engage them to surrender and give the first example of submission. the inhabitants accordingly, not being in any condition to sustain a siege, submitted; but some time after, not being able to endure the unworthy cruelties of the aghuanis , they conspired, revolted, and killed above four thousand of them, on the spot, and the rest were obliged to fly, with the loss of all their baggage; many died with their wounds on the road, of the excessive cold, and having no assistance from surgeons, a very few of them arrived at ispahan , in the beginning of february 1723; and amanulla their general was with much difficulty cur\\'d of a wound he received from a musket-ball in the right shoulder.246 the news of this defeat afflicted mahmoud extreamly, and made him sensible how necessary his presence was to reduce the rest of the realm, to his obedience: yet he de...[cut off] ...in his absence some suddain [sic] revolution should at once lose him the fruit of all his victories; in truth, he had nothing to fear from shah hussain, nor from the princes of the blood, who were shut up, and under the guard of his own and faithful friends; but the nobles of the kingdom, who had their liberty, might, when he was busy in distant wars raise a spirit in the people, and make themselves once more masters of the city and the fortifications. \\' 2.76 \\'the continuation of the history of the late revolution in persia,\\' the american weekly mercury (thursday-thursday, 9-16 november, 1727): \\'to prevent this, and secure the city, he immediately brought into the town from the neighbouring provinces, as many of his own sect, as he cou\\'d gather, whom he disposed in those houses which were left vacant by famine, after which under the pretence of giving an entertainment to the nobles, he got them altogether in his palace, and at once caused them and their children to be murther\\'d: their carcases, three hundred in number, were thrown into the streets, and not content with this barbarity, he slew 1000 soldiers of shah hussain \\'s guards, and 3000 persians. and a few days after this, all those who were able to carry arms were massacred, some in their houses, others in their gardens, and many in the streets, and publick buildings, so that according to a moderate computation, above 25000 men were thus slain in cold blood. mahmoud by this horrible carnage, being rid of all he had to fear, and no people left alive in the town, but those of his own sect, of whose fidelity he was assured, began now to think of making new conquests; accordingly having given his orders, and left a strong garrison in the city and forts, he put himself at the head of his army, in the beginning of may 1723, and march\\'d against the cittadel of guyez .247 this place stands upon a little eminence, and is very strong, and as it is not commanded from any place, it is very difficult to take it but by famine. zerberdert kan,248 a general officer of the aghuanis, had attack\\'d it often unsuccessfully, mahmoud , on his arrival, summon\\'d it to surrender, and being refused by that governor, he immediately order\\'d 4000 guebres to take possession of the gates, to force them, and oblige the garrison to capitulate, this enterprize did not succeed to his wish, the guards of the cittadel mindful of what pass\\'d in the army, viewing the guebres with hatchets in their hands advancing towards their gates, gave them at once a discharge of all their artillery, more than 2000 of them were kill\\'d, and the rest terrify\\'d retired to their camps. but mahmoud considering if the besieged continued obstinate, how dear it wou\\'d cost to take the place by storm, and believing it wou\\'d be troublesome to inveset it and reduce it by famine, took a different method from what he did before at ispahan , he sent a large sum of money to the governor, with assurances if he wou\\'d surrender the cittadel, he shou\\'d have more, and a very good government, more considerable than that which he held: neither did he forget to bribe the soldiers of the garrison, each had his present, and soon after the cittadel submitted: mahmoud immediately placed 1000 aghuanis in garrison there, turn\\'d out the governour and soldiers, and took them in to his army, under a pretence to let them partake his victories. from this place he took his rout [sic] to ben ispahan ,249 a little town situate on the decline of a hill, at the bottom of which there is an agreeable and fertile plain, water\\'d by several rivulets, which makes it the most delightful place in the whole province of airak . this town made a gallant defence, and many perished before, and in the town, during a whole month, in which it was besieged; but then, press\\'d by misery, it surrender\\'d at the instance of ziberdert kan , on honourable conditions. the aghuanis now began to think of leaving ispahan, and obliging the other provinces to submit. but as they every hour were in fear of some sudden revolution in favour of prince tamas, whom the people began to follow, it was thought necessary for mahmoud to remain in the conquer\\'d country with some part of his army, to be at hand in case any trouble should arise suddenly, and that kier soltan250 with the other part of the army, shou\\'d endeavour to make himself master of the rest of the provinces, and most considerable cities of the kingdoim; thus the army was divided into two bodies, kier soltan with the greater part had under him ziberdert kan he marched into the province of faristan which after a generous defence, submitted at last, as we shall see hereafter, mahmoud kept only with him 25000 men, with which he marched to attack kulpekin .251 2.77 \\'the continuation of the history of the late revolution in persia,\\' the american weekly mercury (thursday-thursday, 16-23 november, 1727): \\'this town 30, or 35 leagues from ispahan, and situate in a plain barren for want of water, held out stoutly for prince tama s: it was well provided with men, provision and ammunition, the cittadel particularly was supply\\'d with every thing for a long defence. when mahmoud arrived and was apprised by his spies, of the good condition of the place, and the resolution of the inhabitants to make a good defence, he began to have apprehensions, and to repent he had advanced so far with so small an army. but however, not willing to suffer the shame of abandoning his enterprize, he began the attack in three places at once, and with so much order and courage, that in spite of the vigorous resistance of the besieged he made himself master of some part of their outworks, which were afterwards of great use to him, in checking the continual sallies that they made. prince tamas who was about two days march from kulpekin with eight thousand men, under the command of fredon kan 252 of the sect of the aghuanis , having been apprized of the danger of the besieged, came with his army to their relief, and march\\'d chearfully, as if he were assured of success: the small army of the enemy, whom the continual rains, and extreme cold had much incommoded the fidelity of the inhabitants, and the goodness of the troops within the town confirmed prince tamas that his general must conquer; but he was deceived for so soon as ever they arrived, fredon kan, by the blackest of treasons went over to mahmoud, with the major part of the prince\\'s troop, which he commanded, and they immediately charg\\'d the troops about the person of the prince, as well as those who guarded the intrenchments, and seized all the advantageous posts of which they were possessed: the inhabitants of the town, confounded at this unforseen revolt, and not knowing what to do, in the confusion they were in, abandon\\'d their works and fled into the fortress, which a little time after was taken by the enemy, and the town given up to be plunder\\'d by the soldiers, and the citizens put to the sword;253 and the prince, with a few followers, who yet remain\\'d faithful to him, retired into the province of mezanderan . the town of cassana ,254 struck with astonishment at this melancholly news, and fearing they should soon undergo the fate of kulpekin, sent the keys of their town to mahmoud, and submitted, and were treated with the gentleness which was due to their submission. after this success, mahmoud determin\\'d to return to ispahan , as well to relax a little from the fatigues of war, as to refresh and recruit his army; and so having left garrisons in both the towns last mentioned, he arrived at ispahan, in the latter end of march 1724. \\'twas about this time, that many were eye-witnesses to the courage and virtue of a young lady of georgia her actions against the aghuanis ought not to be lost in oblivion. this lady having heard that her spouse was kill\\'d by the enemy, in the taking of the bridge and cittadel of ispahan mentioned before, resolved to revenge his death in the blood of those who slew him. she gave the care of her estate, and the two young children which she had, to her brother, disguised her sex, and in the habit, of an officer well armed, without regarding the rigour of the season, or the length of the journey, it being near 400 leagues, she came to ispahan, about this time when mahmoud was making his second entry; so soon as ever she saw the aghuanis, and the place on which her husband was slain, her desire of vengeance work\\'d so violently upon her, that fatigued as she was, without reflecting at all, she threw herself with impetuosity, and sabre in hand, upon a whole body of them, and killed more than twenty, before they cou\\'d seize her. mahmoud, who was made acquainted with the action of this determin\\'d heroine shut her up in prison, not intending to punish her severely, but soon after the aghuanis ungenerously found means to poison her. as yet the success of the army which marched into the province of farsistan, was not known, though they had heard that the town of schiras, the capital of that province, was besieged by kier soltan, that the general was kill\\'d by a musket ball, in the first attack, and his place was supply\\'d by zeberdern kan , who pushed the siege on very vigorously, but nothing more was known, and mahmoud waited with impatience for news from thence. in the beginning of may news came, and such as gave great joy to mahmoud and all his party. schiras was taken, and in this manner: this town, situate on the river bendimir ,255 not far from the antient persepolis, and reckon\\'d with reason, the second town in all persia, was almost intirely block\\'d up in the beginning of the siege. the kan, the governour, and one of the first ministers in the court of schah hussain did all he could to hinder the blockade. there were a great many skirmishes but at last, after they had gained some slight advantages over the enemy, they were obliged to yield to force, and abandon the passages by which provisions might enter the town, though indeed they were not without hope or succour, they knew that baguirchagi , prince of arabia,256 was marching with six or seven thousand men to relieve schiras, but their want of discipline was such, that they were defeated and slain by 1400 aghuanis . the governour having lost by this defeat the only resource they had, and knowing well that his provision and ammunition would soon fail, that three parts of the inhabitants had already perished by famine, and sword, and that the number of the enemy instead of diminishing increased daily, delivered up the town on the 13th of april after a siege of eight months: he supported the siege with all the diligence and bravery that could be expected from a gallant and experienced officer, there were six thousand aghuanis and more kill\\'d in this siege, the city notwithstanding the fair promises of the enemy, was given to the plunder and slaughter of the soldiers, both of which was very great. a conquest of this importance, flatter\\'d very agreeably the vanity of zeberdert kan , and encourag\\'d him to make new ones, accordingly having settled affairs in schiras and placed a good garrison there, he marched to lahr ;257 this little town gives name to a country round it, being formerly besieged by a prince who took the title of lahristan , this town after a small resistance surrender\\'d and received three thousand aghuanis for its garrison. from this place zeberdert kan marched to benderabassi the ancient gombra, whom king schah abbas gave its name in the year 1622, and which formerly had commerce with the island of ormus, which was taken from the portuguese by the assistance of the english, this town and the citadel were taken in a few days. mahmoud now having recovered his fatigues, and refreshed and recruited his army from several of his own sect, who came into the city, continually resolved on his [to] part to pursue his point, and to make an intire conquest of the province of kilan .258 he left ispahan in the month of june at the head of near 30,000 men, but now his good fortune began to forsake him, and this expedition succeeded very ill: he was scarced arrived in kilan, but whether the [?...] of the air, or the [?...] incursions of the arabs, were killed great numbers of his soldiers occasion\\'d it, he return\\'d to ispahan , having lost all his baggage and near three parts of his army. if prince tamas had at this time only been at the head of ten thousand men, to have pursued mahmoud in his retreat, he must have been intirely cut off, and have found himself very soon master of all the enemy had deprived him: but the terror was so great not only among the nobles, but the people, that nobody durst own himself of his party, at least openly, and the prince had not in all more than two thousand men who followed him. this reverse of fortune threw mahmoud into a black melancholly. the dutch who for the sake of commerce had crowded to ispahan , were the first who felt the effects of his ill humour, he caused them all at once to be seized, obliged them to find for their liberty forty thousand tomans, tho\\' they had already paid him twenty thousand: after this the armenians were taxed seventy thousand, and obliged to send fifty chosen virgins of their nation to his seraglio. the french were treated very near as ill as others, for tho\\' they spared their purses, they took their liberty: monsieur gardane , consul of the french nation at ispahan ,259 to whom without injustice we cannot refuse the praise which his wisdom, his good conduct, and his zeal for the interest of the commerce of france merit: was forbidden, as were all the french merchants, to go out of the city; not only not to go out of ispahan on pain of death, but not so much as to send from thence one word in writing on the same penalty: so that whatever desire mr. gardane , might have to inform the court of france of the affairs in persia, it was not for the interest of the nation to run the risque of giving that satisfaction at such a price. but what chagrined mahmoud most, was the news of the revolt of yezed ,260 about ten days journey from ispahan on the side of candahir , the inhabitants of this town at the solicitation of the guebres, who came before it in numbers, had submitted and received a garrison of two thousand aghuanis, but when they learn\\'d the ill situation of the affairs of the enemy, they fell upon the aghuanis , slew many, and drove the rest out of the town. mahmoud as embarrass\\'d as he was, would not suffer this action to pass with impunity; he colleced his troops, and having got together a body of 18,000 men, marched on the 22d of december for yezed, the besiegers made frequent and fierce attacks, but were bravely repulsed by the besieged; each side was wholly bent upon the means of conquest, and happily for the besieged an opportunity offered and was taken. the army of the enemy, had suffered very much not only by the snows which had fallen in abundance, but likewise by the want of all sorts of provisions, the country people who had left their villages and were retired to mount taurus 261 having taken every eatable along with them, so that mahmoud was obliged to quarter a good part of his army at convenient distances for subsistance, which weaken\\'d him very much; the besieged being sensible of this, made two sallies at once of their infantry and their cavalry, and that so warmly that they killed near three thousand of their enemies: mahmoud himself being surrounded by the cavalry escaped with difficulty, but was obliged to quit all his baggage, and make the best of his way with the few who remain\\'d about him. this second defeat, which put it out of the power of mahmoud to enterprize any thing at least for some time, seized him with so extream a melancholly, it was believed it would kill him, and now as he thought himself incommode, and a burthen to himself and others, he resolved to shut himself up and begin the riada,262 a sort of spiritual discipline sometimes used by the musselmen. these exercises consist in voluntarily imprisoning themselves fourteen or fifteen days, and eating nothing but bread and water, nor that neither till after the setting of the sun, and repeating continually in a groaning accent, and as if the voice was drawn from the bottom of the stomach these sounds, hou, hou, hou, till the foam rises to the mouth, and upon the lips, and their strength fails, then they fall into epileptic fits, which they call extasies: and in these sorts of extasies they pretend that the devil is forced by a superior power, to discover the good or evil events of the enterprizes h...[?] about: in this superstitious exercise mahmoud employed himself in the month of february 1725, and when he came out he was very weak, and in a disposition not very distant from madness.263 his head was weaken\\'d with long and severe fasting, a settled melancholly in his blood, his reason seem\\'d much hurt and he imagined he saw people every moment, people who had a design upon his life, and suspected every body, but especially the princes of the blood, whom he was determin\\'d absolutely to root out. \\' 2.78 \\'the continuation of the history of the late revolution in persia,\\' the american weekly mercury (thursday-thursday, 23-30 november, 1727): \\'in order to put this horrible design in execution, he was obliged to be assisted by all his confidents, with whom he enter\\'d one day after dinner into the great hall, where all the princes of the blood were assembled, and schah hassain their father with them, then transported with more than hellish fury, he with the assistance of his armed people, cut in pieces at once the whole royal family excepting only two young princes, one about four and the other five years old, who to avoid their fate threw themselves into the arms of their father as their last asylum; schah hussain, held forth his arms to receive them, embraced them tenderly, and received a wound in his arm, in warding off a blow aimed at them by one of the assassines: the sight of the blood that flow\\'d from the parent, soften\\'d even the cruel mind of mahmoud, who never intended to touch the person of the king, and obliged him to leave these two young princes to him to be the consolation of his old age: there were 105 nobles slain thus, among whom were three uncles of schah hassain, very old, and seven of his nephews. after this inhumane slaughter mahmoud appeared as one possessed, and finding no remedy for this destemper, he caused the armenian priests to be called in, and order\\'d them to consult their alchoran; and to engage them to go heartily to work, he gave them 15000 tomans of gold, and assured them, if he recovered his health, he would restore to them all that he had taken away from them; he made some restitution to the dutch company, but all was taken again by his successor. notwithstanding all this, his sickness increased daily, his body convey\\'d with a leprosy, exhaled a most insupportable smell, his flesh pealed by little and little from the bones, his limbs cou\\'d not support him, and in the attacks of his madness, he used to gnaw and tear his hands and arms with his teeth, and nature doing none of her functions in the ordinary manner, gave up his excrements thro\\' his mouth. the aghuanis seeing the danger of the life of mahmoud , thought of appointing a successor to him, they were inclined to desire the brother of mahmoud, who had been appointed his successor on his demise, to take the government upon him, but he was at a great distance in the province of candahar, and no possible diligence that cou\\'d be used wou\\'d bring him to ispahan , in less than eight or ten months: and it was absolutely necessary that this affair shou\\'d be settled immediately: for the people apprixed of the condition of mahmoud, began to lose their fears, and declare openly in favour of prince tamas , a report was spread, that he was advancing with a powerful army, that the arabs having joined the persians, were marching to their relief, and that the towns waited only his arrival to submit to him. these reports through [sic, though] groundless, intimidated the aghuanis, and shew\\'d the necessity they were under of chusing immediately a person to conduct them at this point; not being able therefore to elect the brother of mahmoud, by reason of the distance, they elected his cozen german acherof who was then in prison as we related above. the deplorable condition that schah hassain was in, at the surrender of ispahan, when he gave up his crown and sceptre to mahmoud, touched every one with compassion, his very enemies felt so sensibly, to be in tears for him. but this acherof , as we have said did every thing he cou\\'d to oblige mahmoud, to receive that unfortunate prince in a manner less fierce and haughty: this liberty he took with mahmoud on this occasion, which tho\\' he then dissembled his dislike of it, he soon after seized him, and clapt him in a dark prison and [?...] confinement. upon this, on the 21st of april, the aghuanis, assembled, and march\\'d sword in hand, to deliver acherof from his confinement, they conducted him immediately to the royal palace, placed him on the throne, and saluted him king of persia. achehof , to maintain himself in this unexpected dignity, to which he saw himself raised, began immediately by causing the head of mahmoud to be taken off, and the heads of his principal favourites: a few days after this, being advertised of some seditious words utter\\'d by some of the soldiers, who were of the body guard of mahmoud, he order\\'d the army to surround them, cut three hundred of them to pieces, imprison\\'d their officers, and broke their corps. zeberdert kan, who about this time returned triumphant from his conquests, was honour\\'d, and all his officers and dignities were preserved. as to the persians, acherof pretended to shew particular regard to them. the design he had to draw prince tamas into his hand, and by his death to secure the throne for ever to his family, made it absolutely necessary for him to dissemble thus and to make an outward shew of particular zeal to the royal family, and to discover upon all occasions, a disposition whenever it shou\\'d be in his power, to place the crown upon the head of the lawful prince: therefore he began his reign with a visit to schah hassain, consoled him upon the bloody assassination of his family by mahmoud, and gave him what comfort he cou\\'d, he caused the scatter\\'d bones of his relations to be collected and placed them under a magnificent mausoleum, in the town of kan , the antient place of sepulture of the persian kings. he sent likewise rich presents to the mosch [sic, mosque], in which they were placed, and one thousand tomans to be destributed among the poor: after this with his crown and scepter in his hand, he came in the most submissive manner, and threw himself at the feet of schah hassain, imploring him earnestly to take the government of the realm again, or to oblige prince tamas to take it. schah hassain , who seem\\'d very well to understand the meaning of this offer, and who knew if he discover\\'d the least inclination of remounting the throne, his life must answer it, answered acherof , thus, \"that he was obliged to him for the zeal he express\\'d to his person, but that having voluntarily quitted the government, he cou\\'d not by any means think of taking it again; as to what regarded his son, he wou\\'d not intermeddle, nor oblige him to accept a dignity which perhaps he might make a very ill use of.\" acherof, still concealing his purpose, seem\\'d as if he were uneasy at this determination of schah hassain , however, than he might not be wanting, as he said, in his respect and duty, he sent a magnificent embassy to prince tamas , with considerable presents, and horses richly caparison\\'d, inviting him to come and take possession of the throne, and praying that he would please to appoint a place where they might meet, and settle affairs in order to it: the prince too easy to credit what pleas\\'d him, came blindly into the net, and appointed the little plain of theran [sic, tehran] for the rendevouz. acherof, transported with this successful beginning of his plot, marched immediately at the head of 12000 men, and arrived first in the plain, and posted his troops in such manner as they cou\\'d most easily execute his purpose. the prince advanced only with 3000 men, but having happily heard that acherof had a great number of troops with him, he began to fear and suspect, but however not being perfectly satisfy\\'d of the truth of the report, to be certain, he sent before him allam kan ,264 with two thousand men, reserving only one thousand about his person. allam kan arrived, and perceiving not only a large army of aghuanis , but likewise that all the avenues, to the camp were guarded, found it was very plain their design was to seize the prince. upon this he immediately gave him notice, and desired him to take care of himself, and it was time to give him notice, for acherof advertised by his spies of the near arrival of the prince, had privately posted 2500 aghuanis behind a hill, to cut off his passage, and every possibility of an escape: so that he was just upon the point of seizing him, when notice was given the prince to take care of his life. \\' 2.79 \\'the continuation of the history of the late revolution in persia,\\' the american weekly mercury (thursday-thursday, 30 november-7 december, 1727): \\'this unfortunate prince was upon this obliged to mount immediately, and take refuge with about 200 horse in the town of theran .265 acherof finding his design discovered, immediately attacked allam kan , who defended himself very gallantly, against so great inequality of forces, and repuls\\'d the enemy twice with loss; but at length, the night approaching, he retired and joined the prince in theran. the enemy ignorant of the roads, and fearing to be engaged in the night too, near the mountains, durst not pursue them. in the mean time, allam kan, forseeing that acherof would besiege the town, advised the prince immediately to leave it, upon which having refreshed their troops, they marched out and the prince at their head, in the beginning of the night, and with such diligence, that at break of day they were six leagues from theran , on the side of mezanderan : that which allam kan foresaw happen\\'d, for acherof had invested the town, to the great surprize of the inhabitants, before day break, imagining he shou\\'d seize the prince on his march: he had taken some peasants for his guide; but finding the prince escaped, he in great fury stormed the town, and order\\'d his soldiers to spare none, but he put all to the sword. after this, the towns of kam ,266 or sava ,267 were taken, they were treated with less cruelty than theran , the soldiers only plunder\\'d the town, and saved the people. acherof , not thinking it proper to push his conquests farther, his army not being great, returns to ispahan , where he meditated the destruction of those few of the nobility who had escaped the sword of mahmoud: in this manner; the number of soldiers which acherof took with him to meet the prince, gave a jealousy to the nobles, that this interview was designed more for the benefit of acherof than of the prince; therefore, the fears they had least the prince, whom they tenderly loved, should be surprized, and be blindly led into some bad measures, they resolved to give him their advice: they wrote to him, and this letter was intercepted by scedal ,268 one of the generals of the aghuanis , and sent to acherof, who to revenge himself of the nobles for this action, caused them all to assemble in the royal palace, under the pretence of asking their advice in matters of the last importance, and there were they all murther\\'d: at the same time he put out the eyes of an infant, the grandchild of schah hassain ; and some say he practis\\'d the same cruelty on schah hassain himself, but this was not certain. every one expects the brother of mahmoud at ispahan , when he comes as he certainly will, a civil war between the aghuanis must infallibly be the consequence, theis may probably give an opportunity to schah hassain to remount his throne. during these troubles in persia, the neighbouring princes were not idle, but made incursions, and seiz\\'d the provinces on their borders. the muscovites took schrivan , a fruitful and beautiful country, extending itself along the caspian sea , and laying convenient for commerce. the turks were those who gained most they have by little and little, got possession of all georgia , and of the provinces of erivan , nakman ,269 alderbesan 270, kalan ,271 and havadan ,272 with their several dependencies, cities, towns, &c. some of them made a generous and long resistance; tauris among the rest, which did not submit till after a long and vigorous siege, and after having suffer\\'d very near the same miseries as ispahan . the conquests of the turks, and their near approach to the capital from which they were not more than five or six days march, obliged acherof , who was in no condition to oppose them, to send on the 2d of september 1725 an embassy to the port, to desire peace of the grand signior, at any price, and on what conditions he should please. the embassador\\'s273 present was 20000 tomans in gold, yet for all this, \\'tis believ\\'d the turks will push their conquests, and when they have pillaged ispahan , place prince tamas on the throne, garrison the strong towns, and oblige that prince to act as their lieutenant in persia. 3. from the

themselves with all necessaries, and to give them a bounty of 1500 rixdollars14 per company, to encourage them to do their duty. the same day risa kulachan , minister of persia,15 went without

accomodation before a restitution be made to that monarch of the provinces conquer\\'d by the turks,30 and satisfaction for the losses which persia has suffer\\'d ever since, and which his royal highness justly imputes to them as aggressors, amounting to 40 millions. the same advices confirm, that a negotiation is actually carrying on between the said prince and the late sultan\\'s son;31 and

receiv\\'d many and repeated advices, that the troops of the grand signior,37 quarter\\'d about bender38 increase daily, and that they had sent a train of artillery and ammunitions of war thither, it is feared more than ever that his highness will declare war against the muscovites as soon as he shall have made peace with the king of persia,39 and frequent councils are held on this subject to endeavour to prevent this war, by the means of negotiations. on the 12th our court receiv\\'d an express from constantinople, with letters from m. ...[ne]pluef, the czarina\\'s40 resident at the

near eriwan ,52 had the misfortune, among a great many others, to be taken prisoner by the turks, having been conducted hither [constantinople], was at first very kindly received by the sultan:53 but their friendship was very shortlived; for the grand seignior having done that persian the honour to hold a conversation with him about the affairs of his country, and having ask\\'d him, among other things, whether schach thamas would be content with the conquests he had already made? the captive chan resolutely answered him, no; but he might depend on it, the schach his master designed to conduct his army to scutari on the other side of the arm of the sea, in asia minor over against constantinople. which bold answer the ottoman emperor took so much dudgeon, that without regard to his character, he immediately ordered him to be beheaded before the windows of his apartment. 54 moreover, the sultan being informed that the ambassador upon the road hither from schach thamas, had it only in command to compliment his highness upon his accession to the ottoman throne,55 without any other commission; and that he had not demanded the usual passports for himself and attendants, so that he might be look\\'d upon as a spy; the said ambassador was thereupon arrested at nicomedia , where his credentials and presents were taken from him, and he was sent on board a galley in the island of tenedos.\\'56 3.18 \\'muscow, june 28,\\' new england weekly journal (thursday, 27 september, 1731): \\'the last advices from derbent take notice, that the new sophy57 was gone to ispahan, leaving one of his generals to command in chief during his absence, when the late stroke was given the persians at erivan; that upon advice of his army being forc\\'d to quit the field, with the loss of 10,000 foot, he set out immediately for the camp, resolv\\'d to attack the turks before the arrival of their expected succours from constantinople, which are said to amount to 40,000 men; for which purpose he sent orders for the troops quarter\\'d thereabouts to march and reinforce his army; for the infantry to encamp under tauris till his arrival; and the horse being much superior to that of the turks, to make an irruption into the enemies territories, and ravage the country.58 they further add, that the unfortunate prince59 left with the command of the army was taken prisoner in the defeat, and conducted to constantinople, where he had the honour to be presented to the grand signor,60 and receiv\\'d with greats marks of distinction; that his sublime highness discoursing with him one day on the affairs of persia, ask\\'d him if he tho\\'t the sophy, his master, would be willing to join in the re-establishment of the peace of the two empires, and content himself with the conquests he had already made in the ottoman empire; the undaunted prince made answer, he believed not; and was rash enough to add, that he hop\\'d shortly to see prince thamas at the head of his army at scutari, over against constantinople; whereat the sultan was so enrag\\'d that he order\\'d him that instant to be taken from his presence, and beheaded under his window; that his sublime highness perceiving the small appearance of concluding a peace with persia, has given orders for a considerable body of troops to go and join his army, and improve the advantage lately gain\\'d over them; and understanding that the embassador from prince thamas had no farther instructions than barely to compliment his sublime highness upon his accession to the throne, sent orders for his excellency to be

such vigour; that after a bloody battle the turks, fatigu\\'d with so long a march, were obliged to retire in disorder, with the loss of above 16,000 men killed on the spot, besides 20 pieces of cannon, and all their baggage: the fight lasted till night, which was the reason the persians took no more than 2000 prisoners: after this action the sophy rejoining the rest of his army, signified to the governor of erivan,71 that if he did not in three days surrender prisoner of war, he with all his garison [sic] would be put to the sword. these letters add, that general lewashau had received

usual complements [sic] on both sides, the plenipotentiaries of the ottoman porte began in this manner: \"the serasquier, achmet bashaw,171 by virtue of full powers from the grand signor,172 has deputed us to enter into a negotiation, the success whereof will be of great advantage to the king your master; nor shall any care be wanting on our side to bring the said negotiation to a happy issue: but since that depends not wholly on our endeavours, tis incumbent on you to pre-inform us what your pretensions are, and how far the king your master, has authorised you.\" the persian plenipotentiaries made answer, \"that the illustrious house of persia had been ever engaged in strict friendship with the ottoman porte, which nothing but the unexpected turns of providence, attended with civil discord, could have broken: but now it was their ardent desire to reunite the two empires, and settle a firm and lasting peace between them.\" the turkish ministers then required them to declare their true intentions without reserve, to serve as a basis to the treaty. here the persian plenipotentiaries demanded in general that all the provinces taken from them should be restored, and the peace resettled upon the same foot it stood in the reign of sultan solyman,173 of glorious memory. the turks reply\\'d, \"your demands surprize us; these are new proposals: it was ever the custom when princes at war with each other conclude a peace, not only for the conquerer to retain his conquests, but for the conquer\\'d to offer still further advantages: history both ancient and modern abounds with examples in confirmation of this practice, which you cannot be ignorant of; besides, in the treaty which you quote betweeen our ancestors under the emperor solyman, it was agreed, by way of preliminary, that the provinces of schildin,174 cars , van, with several others, should remain in the possession of the porte; whereas you, instead of offering some places, beyond what the chance of war has put into our hands, are pleased to demand the restitution of those very places which have been long subject to the laws of the ottoman empire, the conquest whereof has cost so much blood and treasure.\" the persians allow\\'d the equity of their argument, but added, \"that an empire so powerful and extensive as theirs, might well overlook a few corners of land, in so ruinous a state that they were fitter for the habitation of owls than the valiant ottoman soldiery: however, those very countries, tho\\' of no consideration to the turkish empire, were valuable to the persians, who

general and brother in law,179 had been at ispahan, where he had found schach tamach the sophy leading a very voluptuous and idle life, being entirely given up to his pleasures. he took the liberty to reproach him with it, saying that his conduct was unworthy a sovereign. this angered the sophy very much, who told tachmach culicam, that he should lose his head for speaking to him in that manner: upon which tachmach culicam, who is master of the army, secured the sophy\\'s person, and has since sent him as a prisoner to mischer.180 after which he placed the crown, as an ensign of royalty, upon the cradle of the sophy\\'s son,181 who is an infant of 4 months old, and a sabre at the feet of the cradle, and has taken the child with him to casbin,182 where he designs to reside. \\' 3.75 \\'hague, january 25. n.s. ,\\' the boston gazette (monday-monday, 9-16 april, 1733): \\'it is some weeks ago, that the very extraordinary news from persia has been published here, of which we have hitherto taken no notice. the distance of that country from ours, and the uncertain correspondence from one to the other, saving what passes through the canal of the jesuits, made us look upon those accounts as apocryphal. it is not long since we saw a tedious and impertinent narration of pretended conferences of peace between the persian and turkish plenipotentiaries: it was first printed for the entertainment of the beau monde in the french mercure, out of which it was drawn off into the amsterdam & other gazettes, and as no sort of adulterated commodities fail of a market in england, it received there the mark of authenticy. but now we have a confirmation of this new revolution from muscow, from constantinople, from vienna accompanied with particular circumstances, which we shall give you thus: that the athemat doulet, thamas kouli kan, that is to say, the first minister thamas prince of kouli, being at the head of 120,000 persians, to oblige the turks to change the shameful articles of the last treaty of peace, concluded in his absence, was informed that the sophi, or schach thamas, was taking measures at ispahan to render his own (most certainly) effectual; and that this monarch was resolved absolutely to ratify the peace so disadvantageous to his country, kouli kan, upon this advice marches with 70,000 men chosen troops, to ispahan, surrounds that capital, and directly seizes the person of his prince: he reproaches him with indolence and cowardice, and immediately orders his eyes to be put out. he afterwards shews the son183 of the unhappy king to the people, aged only 6 months, and proclaims him king or schach in his place declaring himself at the same time his governour, the protector of persia. as soon as this terrible work was over, he banished the dethroned sophi to one of the most distant provinces in that vast empire. it must be acknowledged, that the fate of this prince has been most deplorable! snatched by the greatest good fortune in the world from the sword by which his father hussein184 perished, what seas of trouble was he tossed in, before he could remount his throne, and triumph over that audacious userper [sic] esreff?185 now we see the man that he held dearest, whom he honoured with the first dignity of the state; in a word, the person whom he loaded with his favours, become his tyrant and executioner. he has deprived him of his sight; and who can expect that the life of the infant prince will be of long continuance; the destiny of this tender sprig of royalty being absolutely in his hands? frightful revolution! this may be a lesson to kings, not to deposite their entire authority in the hands of any subjects whatever, who rarely fail to make use of it against them, when it can give the least colour to their own rash enterprizes, on the common and spacious pretence of publick good; when they have the least apparent injustice to complain of; or when they imagine themselves the least capabel [sic] of

his troops to make an incursion on the side of hendeza,189 the same had been repulsed by the ottomans, which gave birth to a report, that the latter had gained a complete victory over thamas kouli kan; which (we are since assured) proves false, and without foundation, the ottoman army in persia not being yet in a condition to hazard a battle with the persians, for which reason most of the

be concerned in the plot, some of whom have been executed, and others sent into exile;190 after which the guard of the young sophi191 was doubled, upon a discovery that the conspirators designed to make themselves masters of the person of that prince, with a view to govern the state in his name till a favourable opportunity should offer to restore the deposed sophi192 to the throne.\\' 3.80

revolution in persia, as transmitted to the ottoman porte by achmet bashaw of babylon,\\' the american weekly mercury (thursday-thursday, 12-19 july, 1733): \\'thamas kouli-kan, who had long cherished ambitious views, hearing of the treaty which the sophi193 his master had concluded with the ottoman porte, thought that incident aforded him a favourable opportunity of executing the design he had conceived to possess himself of the crown of persia. in order hereunto, having first recovered the province of yerack,194 he gave out, that the treaty being too disadvantageous to the nation he could not come into it, but was resolved to march with his army towards ispahan to persuade the sophi, as he pretended, to continue the war with the grand seignior.195 the sophi of persia, who was no stranger to his prime minister\\'s ambitious designs, forbid him to advance with his army, and commanded him to halt in the province of korassan , till he heard farther from him. thamas kouli-kan, who had his particular views, obeyed, and contented himself with intreating the sophi to send some of his officers or ministers to him, in whom he reposed the greatest confidence, that he might conferr with them about the interests of the nation, and communicate to them his views and designs: the sophi readily came into this, and nominated several deputies, who repaired to kouli-kan\\'s army: that general, to gain the greater credit with them, appointed iman riza\\'s tomb, who is counted a saint, and holden in the highest veneration by the persians, to be their place of meeting: he opened the conference, by giving the deputies the strongest assurances of the sincerity of his setiments [sic], which he confirmed with the most solemn oaths; telling them, that he had no other meaning, in the proposal he made to march his army into the province of ispahan, than to proceed with them to the frontiers of turky, that the persians might revenge all the cruelties which the turks had exercised upon them. the deputies were deceived with these false pretences of sincerity and plain dealing; and undertook to carry a letter from kouli-kan to the sophi, wherein he assured that prince that he had no other ambition than to advance his glory; and that if he would permit him to draw toward ispahan with the army, he would do nothing without his express order. the sophi, far from relying upon the protestations of his general, marched out of ispahan, and encamped 5 days journey from that city, designing to get together all the troops he possibly could, and to form an army capable of making head against kouli-kan\\'s. at the same time he wrote to that general, expressly forbidding him to enter the province of ispahan with his army, upon pain of disobedience. upon these possitive orders, kouli-kan thought it his best way to dissemble, and answered the sophi, that he was ready to obey: but notwithstanding his apparent submission, he privately wrote to his friends at court, to use their utmost endeavours to persuade the sophi to quit his camp: this they executed so effectually, crying thamas kouli-kan\\'s fidelity up to the skies, that at last the sophi was over-persuaded, broke up his camp, and returned to his capital. no sooner did the general receive advice hereof, but he decamped with his army, and detached his most trust officers with small bodies of men to possess themselves of the most important posts in the neighbourhood of ispahan; so that in a very short time he became master of all the passes through which the sophi might have got out of the city, when he kept in a manner, blocked up. all this while, kouli kan\\'s friends, who were near the sophi, used their utmost endeavours to persuade that prince to invite the general to court: the sophi, perceiving too late the mistake he had committed in quitting his camp, and knowing that he was surrounded by his enemies, found himself under a sort of necessity to comply, and wrote to his general to come and receive marks of his satisfaction and benevolence. thamas kouli-kan, immediately upon the receipt of this letter, advanced towards the city of ispahan, and caused his army to encamp near it. two days after his arrival, he demanded audience of the sophi; which being granted, he entered ispapan [sic] with some troops, and the principal officers of his army: being introduced into the hall of audience, he approached schach thamas\\'s throne, and told him, he was his prime minister; that as such, the care of the affairs of state belonged to him; that his majesty ought to be persuaded of his fidelity by the important services he had rendered him, &c. the sophi, reduced to the fatal necessity of cringing to his general answered, that he was persuaded of his fidelity, and made him the depository of all his authority, &c. thamas kouli-kan being withdrawn, lost no time in making use of the authority, so lately confirmed to him: the first step he took, was to seize two of the principal officers of the crown, who were most in the sophi\\'s confidence: he reformed the other officers whom he knew to be true to their sovereign; and still pretending to act by order of schach thamas, he sent for his army to ispahan, under pretence that prince had a mind to review them. matters being thus prepared, that general invited the sophi to come to his quarters, to partake of a splendid entertainment, to convince the people (he said) that his majesty honoured him with an entire confidence: schach thamas not being now in a condition to deny his minister any thing, accepted of the invitation, and was received there with all the honour and respect that were due to him. kouli-kan persuaded the sophi to stay all night with him; but the next day, that rebel having got together the principal officers of his army, and the courtiers he had engaged on his side, he represented to them, that the king being a weak prince, of no courage, and absolutely uncapable of governing the nation, it was necessary to dethrone him and to place his son, miza-albas ,196 upon the throne: it is true, says he this prince is yet in his cradle but i will govern the kingdom as regent, and all men shall soon be sensible of the change. this speech meeting with a general applause, the sophi was immediately seized and imprisoned; and two days after, that unfortunate prince was conducted to the province of khorassan, under a strong guard, with only two eunicks and a few slaves to attend him. after the sophi\\'s departure, kouli-kan went to the palace, and proclaimed the deposition of schach thamas, and the accession of mirza-abbas to the throne: at the same time, that prince, though in his cradle, was placed upon a throne, where all the grandees came to pay him homage. afterwards that perfidious minister, cloathed in a royal robe, and wearing a crown upon his head, seated himself upon the throne, and received the compliments of all the officers of the court, upon his being regent of the kingdom: and then entering the harem of schach thamas, he obliged that prince\\'s sister, and daughter of schach hussein, a princess of exquisite beauty, and who was greatly revered in persia for her vertue, to satisfy his lust.197 he has since seized the royal treasure, and in general every thing belonging to the crown and royal family.\\' 3.81 \\'genoa, march 28,\\' new england weekly journal (thursday, 2 july, 1733) and \\'genoa, march 28,\\' the american weekly mercury (thursday-thursday, 12-19 july, 1733): \\'the master of a french ship arrived here [genoa] in 27 days from smyrna reports, that before his departure, advice was brought thither, that a considerable body of ottoman troops marching to the relief of babylon, were defeated by the forces of thamas kouli-kan, general of the persian army, who afterwards made himself master of that important place.\\'198 3.82 \\'london, april 7, 1731,\\' the boston weekly news-letter (thursday-thursday, 5-12 july, 1733): \\'advices from persia, intimate, that a conspiracy form\\'d against thamas kouli kan, the present regent of that kingdom, and to seize on the person of the infant sophy,199 in order to act under cover of his authority, till they could find means to restore the dethroned sophy,200 was discover\\'d by the vigilance of that general, who had seized divers of the chiefs thereof, and executed some, and banished others. \\'tis certain, that the ottomans are much embarrassed with the persian war, and the rather, because the ticklish situation of their own affairs, occasioned by their late revolution (which has not better\\'d so much as they expected the condition of a people fond of change) will not permit them to exert themselves on this occasion as they otherwise might; and of consequence creates in their administration diffidences, which must unavoidably weaken their hands against this formidable enemy. on the other hand, it must be confess\\'d that the bravery, activity, vigilance, and great abilities of this renowned general, are so conspicuous, that, he wants only a better title to the authority he assumes, to make him deserving of it. this general has renew\\'d his declaration, that he will hearken to no accomodation, till all the places taken from the persians during their late troubles, and given up by schach thamas in the late treaty of peace, be restored; and if the turks cannot find means to divide the persians, on account of the late revolution, (which they have not been wanting to attempt) they may perhaps at last find reason to repent the barbarous and inhuman advantage they took of the terrible distractions of that unhappy kingdom, during the successful usurpations of the late noted miriweys,201 and his successor eschreff 202 nor is it impossible, that when this famous general shall have brought about his purposes, and been the instrument in the hand of providence to scourge the ottomans for their perfidy and baseness; it may then happen, (if what has [...] may justify the boldness of our presage) that his very successes may be the occasion of his ruin, and a means of bringing him to an after-reckoning for his own demerits. for thus has the wisdom and justice of divine providence often manifested itself in its dispensations to the erring sons of men. they write from from [sic] moscow march 18. last; to the following effect: that the persians, by means of their numerous armies, carry on the war with more vigour than ever against the turks: that they had blocked up babylon so close, that nothing could go out or in, not even on the side of armenia, nor would the succours expected from turky, be able to attack the persians in their retrenchments, and that the latter had secured all the passes of the country behind them, and had provisions in plenty: that the seraskier who commands the turkish army, had again sent the persian general, to offer a suspension of arms for 2 months,203 who answer\\'d, that he was willing to conclude a perpetual peace with the ottoman porte, but that before any treaty commenced, they must evacuate to the persians the city of erivan, as a mark of the sultan\\'s sincerity; that after this, a treaty shall begin touching a restitution of all the provinces which had been taken from the persians, and that in case of refusal, he hoped to obtain that satisfaction himself by force of arms, and to remember the affront which had been offered to the persian ambassador at constantinople,204 which he should revenge whenever opportunity happened; and the more, because not long ago, by order of the seraskier, they had cut off the noses and ears of some persian officers who were prisoners, and who were sent back afterwards. \\'tis added that the unfortunate schach thamas was yet living; but very closely guarded in a fortress surrounded with water, near bender abassi.205 the account we have receiv\\'d that the persian general had gain\\'d a great advantage over the turks, and taken babylon upon it, is confirm\\'d by a ship arriv\\'d at naples from alexandria; the capt. whereof reports that 4000 turks were killed in a battle on that occasion.\\' 3.83 \\'naples, march 21,\\' the boston gazette (monday-monday, 9-16 july, 1733): \\'we learn by letters from messina ... that a ship was arrived there from alexandria, the captain whereof reported, that the persians had taken

prevent future tumults.\\' 3.85 \\'hague, april 15,\\' the boston gazette (monday-monday, 9-16 july, 1733): \\'the last letters come from constantinople by way of france, assure us, that the porte finds itself greatly embarrassed, for which all the prudence of two divans can scarce find a remedy: on the one side, kouli kan, protector of persia, has loudly declared that they were not to hope for peace till he had recovered all the provinces, territories, and towns that the turks had ravished from the persians since the fatal revolt of miriweis in the second place, the faction of sultan achmet,206 which became daily more powerful, will have peace with their brethren mahometans, and war with the christians. this insolent faction pretends, that the sultan should go in person at the head of his army, that his presence might encourage the true believers to extirpate from the face of the earth the christian race, hereditary and implacable enemies of the holy laws and the true prophet: these are the sentiments with which certain zealous mussulmans inspire the people, who preach publickly in their mosques a kind of anta croisade. in the mean while the grand seignor is not absolutely of his mind, and the grand vizier doth not advise him to it, because he would thereby expose himself to loose his throne, and perhaps his life, the absence of his highness would not fail extreemly to fortify achmet\\'s party, the other malcontents would join themselves to it, and altogether take such measures, that the sultan would soon see himself dethroned, especially if he should loose a battle. other letters say, that the turks have actually suffered some disgrace by the persian troops, and the consequence of that has been the loss of the town of babylon. we expect that our letters will clear up this piece of news. we also learn that the grand vizier207 had sent for m. nepleuf,208 the russian minister at the ottoman porte who declared to him, that his highness pray\\'d her czarian majesty209 to grant a passage through her territories, to the tartars who were to march into persia, upon which m. nepleuf dispatched immediately an express to his court.210 it is not believed that this will be opposed, knowing that the tartars are a brutal people, capable of breaking the bounds of civility and good-manners, where justice would render them inviolable to other nations. they would be more wild on this occasion, as they are promised not to be held subject to any discipline when they have once set foot on persian ground. they will be permitted to pillage, burn, sack and commit, in that enemy\\'s country, the same disorders that the ottomans. a general league of christianity, against the infidels, might find a more speedy and sure way to come at their destuction [sic]. \\' 3.86 \\'vienna, april 18,\\' the boston gazette (monday-monday, 9-16 july, 1733): \\'the ottoman porte having about 3 months ago received advice, that the persian general,211

journal (monday, 20 august, 1733): \\'our news from persia was so various, nothing could be ascertain\\'d till the arrival of the two couriers on the 10th and 16th instant [april], who brought the following particulars, touching the progress of the persian general before bagdat: the persians in bagdat, who are very numerous, had form\\'d a design to deliver the city into the hands of kouli kan,217 who being but ill provided with cannon, contented himself to block it up, and wait the issue of the conspiracy in his favour; but the bashaw of bagdat218 happily discover\\'d the plot a few days before it was to be put in execution: the persian general being informed thereof, and losing hopes of becoming the master of the town, resolved to leave part of his army to continue the blockade, and go himself to encamp with 25,000 of his best troops on the other side the tygris.219 while the troops were passing the river, the bashaw of babylon sally\\'d out upon the rear-guard, and kill\\'d or drowned about 2000 of them;220 the persian general, to recover the blow, attack\\'d the suburb of kouch kalessi,221 which is divided from bagdat by the tygris, and having plunder\\'d it, encamp\\'d along the river, with design to cut off all communication between that place and the ottoman army, lying in the plains of diarbekir, under the command of topal osman, bashaw: the general had not been long there before the tygris, swell\\'d with the thaw of the snow above it, became so rapid as to bear away all the boats and floats of timber which he made use of to pass over his troops. this unlucky accident put the two bodies of the persian army out of a condition to assist each other, and obliged thamas kouly kan to send orders to the troops which block\\'d up bagdat to decamp, and file off along the tygris till they came over against mosul, where they might privately pass over at low water: at the same time he sent 10 or 12,000 men to surprize the place; but the inhabitants, far from being deceived by the feign\\'d assurances he had given them, that they need fear no hostilities from the persian army, kept on their guard; and no sooner were the persians advanced within cannon-shot, but they let fly the whole artillery of the place upon them: this put the persians into some disorder; yet not so far as to hinder their advancing, and entering part of the town by a gate which was designedly left open; when the inhabitants charged them so briskly, and with such resolution that almost all to a man that enter\\'d were left dead on the spot. the few that escaped were so intirely dispers\\'d as not to make head again, but took to the deserts for shelter. after such disappointments, tis not to be apprehended the persians will make any new attempt on a sudden. the bashaw of babylon sent word upon it to the turkish general, that he need be no longer solicitous about the city, which was sufficiently provided with necessary ammunition, and he believed in pretty good security. topal osman, the turkish general, has orders, on the other hand, to attempt nothing, nor stir from his camp, till he is join\\'d by the new troops on their march thither. his army is already composed of 60,000 men, and he has received a considerable convoy of provisions from alexandrette.\\'222 3.92 \\'leghorn, may 15,\\' new england weekly journal (thursday, 3 september, 1733): \\'it was talked at smyrna, with great assurance, that the persians had made themselves masters of babylon, after having cut off the entrance of all manner of necessaries, and reduced the place to a famine; which news had caused great murmurings at constantinople, where the populace are again ready for a revolt. this, we are told, has put the ministers of the porte upon means to bring about, as speedy as possible, the conclusion of a peace, which the grand seignior223 offered some time ago to the regent of persia.224 the loss of that important city is imputed to the bashaw, governor thereof,225 who is upbraided with not having made a brave resistance; while that officer lays the blame upon the grand vizier,226 whom he charges with not having sent him sufficient succours to have made a better and longer defence.\\' 3.93 \\'venice, may 22,\\' new england weekly journal (thursday, 3 september, 1733; \\'venice\\'): \\'by letters from constantinople, of the 13th of april, we

advancing with his army to babylon; and as, according to our advices, the tartars, to the number of 30 or 40,000, commanded by the sultans fetih230 and islan ghuerai,231 sons of doule ghuerai,232 formerly cham of crim tartary, have found out a passage in the mountain caucasus, which borders upon tiflis, and are marching in two columns to penetrate into the heart of persia,233 we persuade our

wherein there was a russian garrison, the moscovites opposed his passage, whereupon a battle ensued between the russian garrison and the army of the tartars, which the prince of homburg hearing he

persians to raise the blockade of babylon, is by this time arrived in sight of the persian army. he has orders to give battle to thamas kouli-kan, whose army, tho\\' superior in number to that of the

july the grand seignior was apprized, that the 15,000 janizaries sent to reinforce the army under topal osman, had joined him; and that general was to march with those succours to give battle to the persian army. at the same time came letters from achmet bashaw, governour of bagdad, with advice, that thamas kouli kan was still encamped near mosul; but that he had resolved to quit that camp, and to meet the ottoman army as soon as he heard of their breaking up. these accounts prepared us for the news of a decisive battle between the 2 armies; and we were impatiently expecting it, when a courier arrived the 7th instant [august] and informed us, that on the 29th ult. the persian army was entirely defeated by that of topal osman. that general, whose army was composed of 100,000 men, having marched thro\\' kerkoud ,243 on his way to bagdad, arrived the 19th of that month by break of day in the plain of udjoam ,244 which lies between kerkoud and bagdad. in this plain he met thamas kouli kan, who upon advice of the march of the ottoman army, went from his camp near mosul with 80,000 men of his best troops, resolving to attack topal osman. the two armies being met, the persians began the fight about six o\\'clock in the morning, by a general discharge of their artillery; a body of arquebusiers, mounted upon camels,245 advancing at the same time. the crudes [sic, curdes], who were in the first rank of the turkish army, were at first put into disorder, and turned tail; but when they found that the turks fired upon them, as they did by topal osman\\'s order, they faced about, and returned to the charge.246 the two armies, animated by the example of their generals, fought with so great bravery that during the whole action, which lasted nine hours, the victory was doubtful, till about three o\\'clock in the afternoon the persians having lost 20,000 of their foot, and 10,000 of their horse, and being discouraged by the wounds of thamas kouli kan, who received three pushes of the lance, they abandoned the field of battle, their artillery and ammunition, and fled cross the desarts; and their general, notwithstanding his wounds, made his escape with a small detachment of horse. in this action the grand seignior247 had 7000 men killed, and 7000 wounded: topal osman lay upon the field of battle that night, rested there the next day, and broke up with his army the 21st for bagdad, whither he had written to achmet bashaw, that he would be there by the 24th to confer with him about the farther operations of the compagne. till then he deferred to give an answer to the proposals he received from a considerable body of arabs, that followed the persian army, but after all the great promises they had made to thamas kouli kan, remained idle spectators of the fight.248 the news of this great victory, the consequences of which will, we hope, be as advantageous to the ottoman empire, as glorious for topal osman, was made known to the people the 7th, at ten o\\'clock at night, by firing the cannon of the seraglio, top kana,249 the arsenal, and ships; which has been thrice repeated ever day since, till yesterday morning. \\'250 3.103 \\'foreign affairs,\\' the new-york weekly journal (monday, 10 december, 1733): \\'we see here the following account of the battle between the turks & persians, which imports, that the seraskier topal osman being arrived within sight of the persians, and considering their number and the strength of their retrenchments, he also retrenched his army. by a stratagem of war he feigned to have fear, and by means of deserters made kouli kan believe that he had a design to send a detachment to take a view of his army. the turks kept themselves quiet till the 29th of july, when topal osman made a small motion; upon which kouli kan came all of a sudden out of his intrenchment, with 80,000 all chosen, and topal osman marched out at the same time, and both armies met. at the beginning of the fight the persians pushed the turks vigorously, upon which topal osman alighted from his horse, and putting himself at the head of the janisaries sustained the attack of the persians. in the interim the horse of kouli kan being wounded, that general fell to the ground, upon which his soldiers imagined him to be dead, and began to give way, and the turks pusuing [sic] them, put them entirely to the rout. the bashaw of babylon 251 seeing the enemy defeated, sally\\'d out, and attacked the trenches, driving the persians from thence, with the loss of their ammunition and baggage. \\'tis computed that the persians lost 30,000 foot and 10,000 horse; but this victory cost the turks 15,000 men. 3.104 \\'vienna, sept. 19,\\' the weekly rehearsal (monday, 31 december, 1733): \\'letters from turky confirm

contrary, was incamped between the ottoman army and the city of babylon; that there were only 10,000 men surprized as they were bringing provisions to his camp, which is well fortified, and that he continues firm in his resolution not to enter into an accomodation before the turks have surrendered up all they took by force in the kingdom of persia. letters from the russian merchants at ispahan

with the emperor, vary just as the weather-cock changes. a south wind constantly sends letters from france, mentioning positively, that a treaty is struck up with thomas kouli kan; but a few points more to the east, give us advices from brussels in direct opposition to the other. letters from constantinople, dated the 23d of september [1733], arriv\\'d yesterday by the way of venice, intimate, that however hard the conditions are, upon which the persians offer peace to the turks, yet the porte appears resolv\\'d to accept them, in order to prevent a general insurrection of the people, who are greatly discontented with the war in persia; that as the ignominy of giving back by treaty all the conquests obtain\\'d at so vast an expence of blood and treasure, would incur upon the grand seignior the contempt of his people, and equally expose him to the hazard of being depos\\'d, \\'twas judged, the porte, in order to save their credit, design\\'d to let the persians regain them under colour of arms; for thomas kouli kan, with a body of 40,000 men, was actually advanced towards erivad [sic, erivan],256 without any interruption on the part of the ottoman army.257 these letters add, that the porte was so exhausted both of men and treasure, that it was not believed the grand seignior could be spirited up to a war against any christian power.\\' 3.108 \\'from the gentleman\\'s

several times, yet as often rallied & returned to the charge, there were upwards of 17,000 men kill\\'d on both sides and almost with equal loss, upon the field of battle: but when the janizaries were

was joined in the nick of time by some other persians, who hewed down all before them, and made no prisoners, except a few of the principal officers. the run-aways of the right wing escaped for the most part; but almost 2000 of them were found dead upon the roads, who being wounded had endeavoured to get off. the turks lost nine bashaws & generals, and the persians three, after having given illustrious proofs of their courage in battle. the persians have taken almost all the horse tails in the turkish army; but the few that escaped, could not be pursued by reason of a dangerous morass.

45,000 turks, which were come to succour the city of babilon, above 20,000 of them being killed on the spot, or taken prisoners, the rest finding means to get into the town, which still remains close blocked up. this action was very bloody, the persians loosing therein about 10,000 men; however, their general had so posted his army before the said city, that it was not probable it could hold out much longer.\\' 3.122 \\'hague, april 9,\\' the new-england weekly journal (monday, 15 july, 1734): \\'it is true ... that the peace is made, or as good as made, between the turks and the persians;

ministers of the grand seignior,284 but nothing was published of what was resolved therein; \\'twas however remark\\'d, that the grand vizier285 went often by night to see the mufti,286 to confer with him about means for restoring the affairs of the empire, which at present appear greatly embarrassed:287 that the populace of constantinople, irritated by the bad success of the war in persia, had attempted to excite a general insurrection, and had already set fire to four corners of the city, but by the activity of the grand vizier the flames had been happily and speedily extinguished.\\'

the persians that he has no view of usurping the throne; though at the same time, it is assured, that he has taken care to secure himself an absolute power, and has now considerable armies on foot, with which he will probably keep the turks fully employed in those parts.\\' 3.130 \\'frankfort, sept. 27,\\' the boston weekly news-letter (thursday-thursday, 21-28 november, 1734): \\'though most of

insists on having all the conquests made by the turks on the empire of persia, restored, before he concludes a peace and lays down his arms ... they say also, that two great armies were to be employed

to bind themselves under an oath not to make any peace with the porte, till the pretensions of the sophi for having all the persian conquests restored, are complied with, and for that end it had been resolved to push on the war with vigour, and to reinforce the army with 30,000 men, which, according to a proportioned number, are to be raised in the respective provinces; and that thamas kouli kan was preparing to return to the army, in order to attack bagdat, for which enterprise he was to carry two millions of rubels with him.\\' 3.134 \\'paris, sept. 17,\\' new england weekly journal (thursday, 6 january, 1735): \\'the ottoman porte being entirely averse to listen to the proposals of peace offered on the part of the persians, had ordered their army on the frontiers of that empire

wrote a letter to the seraskier,298 who commands in chief the grand seignior\\'s army on these frontiers, by which he again offered him peace, on condition, however, that the ottoman porte should make an entire restitution of all the provinces and places taken from the monarchy of persia: but as those propositions cannot be accepted, they continue to send from hence [constantinople] troops, money,

\\'everything is confusion in our seraglio, because most of the great men therein form cabals to trip up the heels of their competitors; but as the grand vizier303 has the strongest party, and can always gain some persons over by the great posts he has to bestow, and the sums he can give, he has hitherto maintained his credit; so that we hope, that in case he continues in that high dignity, the peace with the christian powers will be strictly preserved; the rather, because the war with persia has already cost a prodigious number of men, and incredible sums of money; and we believe, is not likely to be at an end.\\' 3.141 \\'vienna, oct. 30,\\' the weekly rehearsal (monday, 31 march, 1735): \\'we have ... letters bringing positive advice, that, notwithstanding the advantageous offers made by france to the ottoman porte, for concluding peace with persia, and attacking the christians, particularly the emperor304 on the side of hungary, the christians had nothing to fear on that account;305 the persians and turks being much irritated against each other.\\' 3.142 \\'vienna, nov. 13,\\' the weekly rehearsal (monday, 31 march, 1735): \\'an express is arriv\\'d here from petersburgh with news that thamas kouli kan, generalissimo of the persian army, had ordered it to be notified to the empress of russia, that he would not make a peace with the ottoman porte, because the consequences thereof might prove fatal to her czarian majesty,306 and also to the emperor of the romans:307 this declaration has occasion\\'d great joy at this court: however nothing is omitted for putting the frontier places of transilvania and servia into a good state of defence.\\' 3.143 \\'london, dec. 20,\\' the weekly rehearsal (monday, 31 march, 1735): \\'we have letters every week from venice, which speak of the peace concluded between the turks and the persians; but from vienna it is often contradicted; so that in the midst of so much contrariety, we are at a loss what to determine. can it be imagined that all these different reports would come from constantinople, purely to make a schism in politicks? i fear those things must be attributed each to the respective side that every one takes in this affair. france and her allies, are willing there should be peace between those two mahometan powers, that one or both of their unbelieving friends might fall upon their christian enemies. the two empires of germany and muscovy desire everlasting war among the musselmans, that no storm might fall on them from the oriental part of the world. but, upon the whole, it is very probable that if they have not made a peace, that it will speedily ensue, for each side must have had a good belly-full of the war by this time. persia, during ezreff\\'s rebellion, has been half depopulated; for not only many garisons, but the inhabitants of several towns, were then put to the sword; and as all the country had submitted to the usurper, the subjects were not brought back to their duty without breathing a vein.308 in the war carried on since, by kouli kan, to recover the lost provinces, all the treasures of that rich empire are exhausted, its commerce ruined, and miseries entailed upon generations to come; so that, to our thinking it would be most impolitick for them to reject the advantageous offers of peace, that have been made them, such as they could never expect, but in a juncture like the present.\\' 3.144 \\'petersbourg, dec. 28,\\' the american weekly mercury (thursday-thursday, 3-10 april, 1735): \\'the persian embassador309 has already had several

for his court, either by the latter end of this month,314 or the beginning of the next. we have receiv\\'d advice from persia, that the turkish general315 had found means to throw a reinforcement of 4000 men into babylon, with a great quantity of ammunition and provisions; that a detachment of 15,000 men, which he had order\\'d to file off towards georgia, had been repuls\\'d with great loss by the persians; that another detachment of 10,000, which were to support them, seeing the misfortune of the former, where [sic, were] returned to the ottoman camp; that thamas kouli kan continued his

been a bloody battle between the turks & persians, the former of which have lost their general, 6 bashaws and 60,000 men, kill\\'d on the spot; so that the emperor351 and czarina352 have little to

evening-post (monday, 13 october, 1735): \\'of the reports that are spread in this city, it is said, that the grand seignior353 having learned that the czarina354 had made a treaty with the persians, by which she abandons all the conquests made in that country by the late peter the great, on condition that thamas kouli kan should continue with all his forces, the war against the turks, his highness has given orders to the cham of the tartars355 to enter muscovy with an army of 60 or 80,000 men until he can send a more considerable one thither.\\' 3.174 \\'london, july 24,\\' the boston evening-post (monday, 13 october, 1735): \\'they write from vienna of the 16th instant [july], that they had an account from venice, that the turks had declared war against muscovy, and had notified the same to the ambassadors of the emperor, england, and holland, at constantinople; and that the tartars had already invaded russia: but as not a word is said from muscovy or poland, and as no christian minister at the ottoman porte writes any thing of it, \\'twas supposed to be reports spread on purpose, and proceeded from the refusal given the tartars, who demanded passage thro\\' the russian territories into georgia for their route to persia. \\' 3.175 \\'by the holland mail we have a circumstantial confirmation of the total defeat of the turks in persia, which came by an express from that country to the court at petersburg. the most material particulars are these, as we find them in an article from thence dated the 12th of august,\\' the boston weekly news-letter (thursday-thursday, 23-30 october, 1735): \\'thamas kouli-kan having defeated a body of 15,000 turks commanded by the bashaw temir ,356 near teflis, march\\'d with his army towards carsa ,357 in order to attack the seraskier abdullach bashaw, who had posted himself with his troops under the cannon of that place. he did all he could to bring him to a general engagement; but the latter refusing to give him battle, kouli-kan could only harass him, which he did with so much success, that after several skirmishes, that always prov\\'d to the disadvantage of the turks, the seraskier was at last oblig\\'d to shut himself up within the town of carsa. upon this the persian general detach\\'d part of his troops to block up teflis, and march\\'d with the rest of his army towards erivan, where was a numerous garrison of turks, whose commander seeing the persians approach, march\\'d out with the greatest part of his troops to attack them. a very smart action ensued, but the turks were obliged to retire into the town with considerable loss, and kouli-kan posted his troops round the place. during this, the seraskier abdullach bashaw taking the opportunity of the persian general\\'s absence, drew his army out of carsa, joyn\\'d several bashaws that were on the march with numerous bodies, and resolv\\'d to go and attack kouli-kan, who was no sooner inform\\'d of the seraskier\\'s march, but he abandoned the neighbourhood of erivan, and went and posted himself in a very advantageous situation, four leagues from that place. abdullach bashaw, who little suspected that the persian general\\'s retreat was only a cloak for a stratagem, was the more eager for pursuing his enemy, because he had just received a reinforcement of 10,000 men from erivan, and his army being increased to 80,000 men, he did not doubt of beating the much inferior army of the persians. presuming upon this, he enter\\'d the mountains in quest of his enemy, and found himself sadly hamper\\'d in defiles, where he form\\'d his army in the best manner that the ground would permit him. kouli-kan having thereupon divided his army into three bodies, attacked the turks with so much vigour, that in a few hours he gained a compleat victory. the turkish infantry, consisting almost all of janizaries, were enttiely [sic] defeated, and were for the most part either kill\\'d on the spot or taken prisoners. the cavalry, who did not make so much resistance, was vigorously pursued above 3 leagues by kouli-kan himself, who totally dispersed them. among the slain are the seraskier abdullach bashaw, two other bashaws of the first rank, and 4 of the second,358 of which number is mustapha bashaw, the grand seignior\\'s son-in-law. among the prisoners, besides several other persons of distinction is mehemet bashaw, who lately arrived in the army with a considerable sum of money from constantinople. the turkish artillery consisting of 32 pieces of cannon, fell into the hands of the conqueror, with all their ammunition, the military chest, baggage, &c. the few scattering troops that escap\\'d the slaughter, retired part to the neighbouring towns, and the rest to the mountains,359 which last will infallibly fall into the hands of the persians. the towns that are besieged or blocked up, having no hopes of any relief since this defeat, the commander at genscha360 has already demanded a capitulation; and \\'tis not doubted but those of the other places will follow his example: so that kouli-kan by this victory, will in all appearance, be soon master not only of all the country which the turks had conquered from persia, but be likewise in a condition to carry his victorious arms into the ottoman empire.\\' 3.176 \\'constantinople, july 6,\\' the boston evening-post (monday, 27 october, 1735) and \\'constantinople, july 7,\\' the south-carolina gazette (saturday-saturday, 15-22 november, 1735): \\'there has been a report for some days past, since the arrival of an express from persia, that the ottoman army had been entirely defeated by the persian general thamas kouli kan; which news has been since confirmed by another express, with the following particulars: the 20th of last moon, which answers to our 10th of june, thamas kouli kan, left his camp at the head of 15,000 men, and appeared in the plain called arpa cairy,361 at some distance from the turkish army, seemingly with an intent to discover the situation of it; which being perceived by the serasquier kiuperly,362 he detached a body of his best cavalry to attack the enemy; but after some slight skirmishes, kouli kan yielded the place to the turks, and retired in good order towards his camp, which he placed on purpose, in posts seemingly disadvantageous, that the enemy thinking to gain a cheap victory, might be induced to attack him; therefore, pretending to be fearful of waiting for them in that situation he marched off, and retreated towards raven; the serasquier and other bassas elated with this pretended flight, pursued the persians very close, till they came to a place where the persian general had placed in ambush two bodies of his best troops, the one in a thicket, and the other in a valley. here the turks were all of a sudden attacked in flank by a general discharge of all the persian artillery, and in the rear, by a party of the enemy, who sallied from behind their covering, to cut off their retreat. on the other hand kouli kan seeing the good success of this snare, faced about with the rest of his troops, and attacked the turks with so much vigour, that their whole army was soon routed with a most terrible slaughter. the particulars of the loss sustained by the ottomans, in this memorable battle, are not yet known; but only in general, that they have been very great sufferers, and that all their cannon, provisions, ammunitions of war, and baggage, fell to the conquerers. the serasquier kiuperly, after he had two horses killed under him, fell to the ground, and whether he is in the number of the slain, or made prisoner of war, we know not. there were but three bassas who had the good fortune to escape with a slender attendance, viz. demer bacha, who is said to be all covered with wounds, chivehiuz mustapha bacha, and gingah bacha.363 yesterday a grand council was held in the seraglio, in presence of the sultan, wherein it was resolved to nominate for the present, achmed bacha serasquier, who is no less famous for his politeness and literature, than for his valour, in which he is thought to exceed all the other bassas; he was formerly deputy governor of babylon: the grand visier,364 in the said council, offered to command the army in persia; and the grand seignior365 declared his readiness to appear at the head of his troops, if there was occasion; adding, that he would lay open his treasures to recover the glory of the empire.\\' 3.177 \\'vienna, aug. 3,\\' the boston evening-post (monday, 27 october, 1735): \\'the general consternation they are in at constantinople, does not hinder the porte from contriving methods to recover their late losses; they are daily assembling their troops, and propose to form an army more numerous than the former; and for this purpose it was resolved to expose the standard of mahomet,366 whereby all persons capable of bearing arms are to appear in the field. \\'tis said that kouli kan, after his late important victory, had intimated to the czarina,367 that now is the proper time to restore the glory of the persian monarchy, and to close up the proud turks within their ancient limits.\\' 3.178 \\'london, august 2,\\' the boston evening-post (thursday, 27 october, 1735): \\'they say from vienna, that the turks had in the late battle with the persians 80,000 men, and that not above 8 or 9000 escaped.\\'368 3.179 \\'london, august 7,\\' the new-york gazette (monday-monday, 27 october-3 november, 1735): \\'letters from constantinople give an account of the stratagem which thomas kouli kan used to obtain the late important victory over the turks. he advanced with 15,000 men to a plain some distance from the ottoman army, with on [sic, no] other view, in appearance, than to reconnoitre their situation; so that the turkish general369 immediately detached a body of his best cavalry to attack him, and the persians accordingly, after a small skirmish, seem\\'d to retire in confusion; the enemy could not decline so apparent an advantage, and pursued with the greatest part of their army; but thomas kouli kan had placed great part of his troops in ambush, and as soon as the turks were in their power, these appeared to cut off their retreat, while the general himself faced about, and attack\\'t him in front; the consequence of which was their total defeat, and loss of all their cannon, provisions, ammunition and baggage. the number of the slain is not certainly known, nor the number of turks taken prisoners. \\'tis certain that the porte is in the utmost confusion in this great event. the grand vizir370 has offer\\'d, in the divan, to command the new army order\\'d to be raised; and the grand signior371 has declared likewise, that in case it was necessary, he would put himself at the head of his troops, adding, that he was ready to employ all his treasures for the safety of his empire.\\' 3.180 \\'the following is a letter from constantinople, dated the 22d of last july,\\' the new england weekly journal (tuesday, 28 october, 1735): \\'conformable to orders from the ottoman porte 100,000 tartars, most of them of crim, are march\\'d in two separate bodies of 50,000 each, one by the way of asoph, and the other by the rout of the deserts. those two bodies are to join in a certain plan, and continue their march towards daghestan on the caspian sea, to oppose the progress of the persians commanded by thamas kouli kan. they have at their head their cham tefterkam;372 and as they are to pass through the territories of russia, they have express orders from the porte to make no ceremony with the russians, but to repel force with force, in case they attempt to oppose their passage. in the mean time the persians, making use of their late victory, have laid siege to the important city of erivan, upon which news the sultan373 sent orders to the capt. bashaw, gianum coggia,374 to come from the islands of the archipelago,375 and go afterwards with his squadron to egypt.\\' 3.181 \\'venice, august 23,\\' the new england weekly journal (tuesday, 28 october, 1735): \\'the last letters from constantinople confirm the defeat of the ottoman army; but tho\\' the accounts given thereof vary in several circumstances, yet it\\'s agreed by all, that this great victory is owing to the wonderful stratagem of kouli kan, which is as follows: \"the persian general having drawn the serasquier abdallah into the streights of a valley, where he had laid several mines,376 he sprung them as soon as a considerable body of turks had passed the streight, he thereby gained his point, by dividing the turkish army, so that it was no difficult matter to defeat that part of their troops which passed the streight, and afterwards to fall upon and rout the rest of the army.\" those letters add, that the famous achmete bassa,377 heretofore governor of babylon, had taken upon him the command of the army in persia, by virtue of an order from the porte, with full power to treat of a peace with kouli kan,378 and \\'tis thought his negotiations will be attended with success, on account of the personal regard and esteem which the persian hero has for him; and as the porte is sensible of his great abilities, \\'tis believed he will be made grand vizier in the room of him who was deposed the 12th past.\\'379 3.182 \\'london, august 12,\\' the boston evening-post (monday, 3 november, 1735): \\'accounts from constantinople by the way of marseilles, say the turks did not lose above 20,000 men in the late battle against the persians; that they are no way discourag\\'d, but on the contrary are hard at work in forming a new army, which is to be much more considerable and formidable than the other.\\' 3.183 \\'london, september 1,\\' the american weekly mercury (thursday-thursday, 6-13 november, 1735): \\'from vienna, an express from the emperor\\'s minister at constantinople,380 brought advice,

pursu\\'d by the ottoman army; upon a signal given, the persians fac\\'d about, and opening in the middle, a train of artillery, which was concealed in the wood, began to fire upon the turks, making a terrible slaughter; being immediately charged by the persians, they turn\\'d tail, leaving near 60,000 killed and wounded, among which were kiuperli,381 who commanded the ottoman army, and six bashaws.382 this defeat was afterwards confirmed.\\' 3.184 \\'london, august 22,\\' the boston weekly post-boy (monday, 10 november, 1735): \\'letters from constantinople confirm, that the grand vizir

misfortunes in persia to his charge; in the ill choice he made of generals sent to command there; an accusation the grand signior,385 who is a weak prince, listned [sic] to, and immediately order\\'d

should undertake any thing against the russian territories, by employing the troops which come from persia, and by arming the cossacks of don,415 who are natural enemies of the turks and tartars. another express arrived from the army of kouli kan, with advice, that that general had totally defeated a considerable body of turks, and that after this victory, he had marched towards kars, a city

arms against the christians.421 other advices from constantinople intimate, that the grand visier422 was to have been strangled, but was pardoned, on account of his former good services in persia, and

frontiers of georgia, and which increased to 30,000 horse, had been terrify\\'d thus, on the unexpected approach of a detachment of 20,000 horse, kouli kan had sent against them from the grand army, that they instantly dispersed, and hardly 100 men of them remained in a body together. the intent of the chief of that herd, who affects to be a kinsman of chack434 tamas, the dethroned sophy of persia, was to induce all persia at the instigation of the ottoman porte, to rise against kouli kan; wherefore the latter sent one of his officers to the governour of derbent, to warn him to be on his guard, and be vigilant over the frontiers of georgia; as those robbers aim at no other thing than plunder, to drive them thence. the said express moreover says, that kouli kan had discovered, that the turks, by their proposals of peace, had only endeavour\\'d to gain time and to reinforce themselves, and that thereupon, he had determined to attack his enemies in their intrenched camp, and finish the war to the glory and advantage of the persian nation, carrying along with him 180 pieces of heavy cannon, with which he intends to attack them.\\' 3.216 \\'london, april 27,\\' the boston weekly

conquests made by the turks on the persians these 200 years past, and subdued the greatest part of armenia by the taking of erivan, pierced into turcomania itself, where he sat down with his army, before erzerum: he was carrying on the seige of that place, when he received advice that an army of turks and persians, leagued against him, and commanded in chief by one laxcie,438 was marching with all expedition towards the caspian sea, in order to join the tartars assembled in daghestan. kouli kan immediately saw of what importance it was to him to stop laxcie in his march; but he could not do that and carry on the seige of erzerum at the same time; nor did the need he had of all his troops in the march he intended, permit him to leave it blocked up. in so delicate a conjecture, assisted by his great genius and fortune, who has never yet play\\'d him the least slippery trick, he hit upon a very singular expedient to prevent erzerum from receiving any supplies of provision in his absence: the expedient, of which our letters confirm the entire execution, was to burn and destroy all the country, and every thing in it, many leagues round the city, and seize all its inhabitants, both turks and christians: the latter he sent to increase the number of those christians who inhabit the fort of caucasus, under the dominion of a patriarch; but the turks he sent prisoners to chorasan, the most northern province of the persian empire. thus being performed, the warlike kouli kan begann his march with his whole army towards daghestan: he came up with laxcie near the borders of the caspian sea, attack\\'d him, cut the greatest part of his army to pieces, and put the rest to the rout. this news is confirmed to us by letters from moscow, where they have had an account of the particulars from

deserted them only because he found himself disappointed in his expectation among the mutineers, for which cause he was condemned and executed at gamberoon. this piece of news gave some uneasiness even to our east-india company, but upon the 28th of december they received letters over land from bombay, dated the 6th of august, by which they had an account, that some of the chiefs, and the most

to make it immediately go down that this mr. somebody, who was tho\\'t to be lost, must be the famous conqueror of the turks, the traiterous race of the unworthy omar. but how impertinent is this, which i even blush at while i am repeating it! can the nazarenes,488 who in other respects are so knowing, be ignorant that the term kan, which they make to be a part of the name of our great general, is only used to express a dignity very much like that of marshal, only the marshals have not, like our kans, troops in their own pay? are those nazarenes ignorant, that according to our religion, laws, and customs, no foreigner, whether a proselyte or not, can be vested with all the authority and power of our sublime sophi? nevertheless, if we consider the various opinions of the infidels about the origin of our great thamas kouli in another view, i think they do him a great deal of honour; for as heretofore the elements disputed about the great prophet mahomet, so the several nations of the earth now dispute and envy one another the glory of being the native country of our matchless conqueror.\\' the anglo-russian commercial treaty and persia 3.242 \\'the treaty of navigation and

there, he was stunned by an unwelcome deputation from the regency, and the inhabitants of that capital, to let them know, that they were indeed satisfied to acknowledge him as a defender of the liberties of their country, but no longer a sophy; and that they were ready to sacrifice their all in support of the lawful successor to the throne;138 whereupon kouli kan , not thinking himself safe in his metropolis, returned to his army on the frontiers of turkey; and afterwards retired to casben,139 a city in the midway between the daipian [sic, caspian] sea and ispahan, about 225 miles from either.\\' 4.65 \\'letter from an ambassador\\'s secretary, at constantinople, concerning thamas kouli kan,\\' the virginia gazette (friday-friday, 29 april-6 may, 1737) and \\'copy of a letter from a secretary of one of the ambassadors at the porte,\\' the south-carolina gazette (saturday-saturday, 2-9 july, 1737; with minor variations): \\'sir, i can now satisfy your curiosity; and you may depend on it, that what i tell you is authentic. thamas kouli kan , was born at afcheir140 in chorazan , a province of persia. his father was a shepherd,141 which profession the son too followed for some time,142 till he took a dislike to it, from a rising ambition to make himself more considerable in the world; and then it was, that he stole 700 sheep from his father, which he sold, and with the money lifted a gang of resolute banditti, of whom he put himself at the head, and then plunder\\'d several caravans, with the booty whereof he enrich\\'d himself very much.143 after having carried on the trade of a common highwayman for 7 years,144 he went to the province of mazandran , to which the king schach hussein had sent his son the prince thamas for security, before he was obliged to yield up ispahan to the rebels.145 the said king being afterward put to death, thamas kouli kan , who by this time had 3000 men under his command, offer\\'d them, together with his treasures, to prince thamas, to restore him to the throne of his ancestors, engaging, at the same time, that he would give him his head, if he did not succeed in his enterprise; provided, that in case of such success, the prince, when he became king, would declare him his prime minister.146 the prince consented to whatever he ask\\'d, such was his entire confidence in thamas kouli kan , who, to give him the stronger proof of his attachment, assumed this new name, which signifies, the slave of schach thamas; whereas he went before by the name of nadir kouli .147 the first thing that kouli kan did, after having raised a very great body of troops, was the driving of the rebels from mached ;148 after which he reduced the province of herat, and carried the governor\\'s head to prince thamas , as a trophy of his victory.149 his army being now become more powerful, he besieged and took ispahan ,150 and reduced the aghuans, a rebellious nation, who had subdued almost all persia. it would be needless to relate his subsequent victories, because they are so well known. he had the policy to carry prince thamas with him in several of his expeditions, to give the more reason to think, that he only ached for that prince. the bravery of kouli kan , his good treatment of the soldiery, and the generosity with which he rewarded them, having procured him their entire confidence, he took that opportunity to seize the government, by the stratagem that was mention\\'d at that time, on pretence, that prince thamas was incapable of governing. in fine, his ambition, or rather vanity, knowing no bounds, about a year ago he got himself declared king of persia, by the principal adherents of his party; but this advancement, instead of establishing his authority, must rather tend to weaken it. he was beloved as the defender of his country; and \\'twas then more devoted to him, than \\'tis now under his pompous title of king. as he has reach\\'d to the throne by usurpation, he has had recourse to cruelty to secure himself in the possession of it. he has put prince thamas, and all the princes of the persian royal family to death, as well as several persian lords, of whom he had a jealousy.151 he has taken the title of schach nadir ; and upon the money coined with his dye, he has put a most vain inscription, signifying, the matchless king, the sovereign of the four parts of the world.152 as to his person, he is about 50 years of age,153 robust, inur\\'d to fatigue, and has a very majestic presence. as to his character, he acts so much by the rules of policy, that \\'tis hard to say, whether the good qualities which have been remarked in him, proceed from a principle of virtue. he seems to be very liberal, especially to his troops, which he, by that means, obliges to observe an exact discipline. he has been seen to act with great magnanimity upon some occasions, especially at the time of the two victories which he obtained over the turks. he caused great funeral honours to be paid to the two generals in chief, who therein lost their lives, viz. topal osman,154 and abdullah kuprogli;155 and he order\\'d the prisoners he took on both occasions, to be treated with all civility possible.156 he has also been known to perform actions of equity. he is a man of wisdom and penetration, but is reckon\\'d very artful. he is moreover intemperate to excess, and very much addicted to

prefers the french before all other foreigners.158 after he had taken tifflis, the missionaries who were settled there under the protection of the crown of france, went to wait on him, when he received them very friendly, made them sit down with him, and told \\'em, that he always had an extraordinary friendship and esteem for their nation, and a profound respect for the french emperor159 (a title which is established in the east for all kings) and that all his subjects should be treated in persia, with more distinction than those of any other nation in europe.160 when the audience was over, he gave them all the money he had about him; and he has since not only confirm\\'d, but also augmented all their privileges, &c.161 when baki kam,162 ambassador from kouli kan , left this place, he carried with him several mullas or doctors of the turkish divinity, in order to confer with the doctors of persia, on ways and means for reconciling the turkish sect of omar, with the persian sect of ali;163 who, tho\\' both mahometans, hate each other to such a degree, that they reproach one another with being omar\\'s dogs, and ali\\'s asses. the point in view is, to see if they can unite the two parties in some degrees of that faith, more or less, which they place in the blessed state of mahomet, and in the miracles ascrib\\'d to him. the porte had resolved, that an ambassador should have gone with that minister to ratify the peace, and to recognize kouli kan king of persia; but having received advice of the stand that is made against him since he took that wrong step of assuming the title of king, and being informed moreover, that the persian malecontents are supported by the usbeck tartars , and that part of his army has actually been defeated by the malecontents within 2 leagues of ispahan ,164 \\'tis presumed, from the temper the porte was in upon the receipt of these advices, that the grand signior165 will not be in a violent haste to perform the terms of the peace concluded with kouli kan , especially their engagement to maintain him on the throne. on the contrary, \\'tis believed, that as the porte only agreed to the peace out of a political necessity, they will not hesitate much in taking other measures, if their interest requires it.\\' 4.66 \\'petersburg, jan. 20,\\' the south-carolina gazette (saturday-saturday, 7-14 may, 1737): \\'an express which

one of the russian empress\\'s cabinet ministers, to the grand vizir, concerning the motives which influenced the czarina to declare war against the turks,\\' the virginia gazette (monday, 30 september, 1737): \\'the hostilities [between russia and ottoman turkey] continued increasing during the year 1719, and the three succeeding years. after that juncture those generally known troubles happen\\'d in persia, which kingdom was reduced to a very great extremity, by a general revolt of the auganizes182 and lesgintzes183 against the shah their sovereign: which revolters not only murder\\'d at shamaki several russian merchants and seized their effects, to the value of more than a million of millions of rubles, but they likewise formed the design of attacking the old russian provinces. in order to chastise those rebels, and prevent any other power from possessing the coasts of the caspian sea, the emperor peter i. caused a part of his army to march into persia; and commanded his resident at constantinople to give ample information of the true motives of that expedient. the sublime porte did however receive under her protection the said rebels, who were the determined enemies of russia, contrary to their treaties both with the persians and russians. notwithstanding all this, his imperial majesty readily condescended to a treaty, whereby were settled the boundaries between the russian and ottoman empires, with respect to persia. but the porte seeing herself in possession of the provinces which she had occupied by virtue of this treaty, immediately passed the prescribed limits, seized on the city of ardebil, and on divers other places, as well in the territory of hamadan, as elsewhere, and even resolved to possess herself of ispahan, the capital of persia. the design upon ispahan having been frustrated through the opposition of ashraff, the porte found it to her purpose to strike up a separate peace with him, and leave to russia the whole burden of the war against ashraff; who accordingly, on this his peace with the ottomans, immediately attacked the russian troops in ghilan; but was utterly defeated. the towns seized by the turks, beyond what was due to them conformable to the treaty made with russia, gave occasion for a new war between shah thamas and the ottoman porte. shah thamas very strenuously sought the assistance of russia: but his imperial majesty, to avoid giving the porte the least umbrage, did not enter into any engagement with the prince. but the ottoman porte scrupled not concluding with him a separate peace, restoring to shah thamas the provinces of hamadan and tauris. upon this his imperial majesty, who never designed to make any conquests in persia, made peace with the shah, and delivered up to him the provinces of ghilan, astara, &c. not reserving the other places situate on the borders of the caspian sea; with any view whatever, but to hinder any foreign power from possessing them. the peace between the ottoman porte and persia, was presently interrupted by fresh misunderstandings, which terminated in open hostilities. on occasion of this new war, the ottoman porte thought proper to invite russia to concur with her to terminate the troubles in persia. to which russia concurring, the ottoman porte dropt her first demand, and told the russian resident, that russia had nothing to do but to observe on her side a perfect and exact neutrality, while the ottomans should manage their affairs in persia by way of arms. russia, far from disagreeing in the least from such a neutrality, gave the most convincing proofs of the disposition she was in to keep up a good intelligence with the porte: who, after some bad success in this war, devised a frivolous pretext to reproach russia with a view of extending her dominion from sherwan 184 to georgia, and with her having made a secret league with the persians. though this surmise was without the least foundation, her imperial majesty, the czarina, being willing to take away from the porte all subject of complaint or diffidence, and to shew she meant to take no advantage in persia, restored to persia all those places situate on the coast of the caspian sea, which formerly appertained to the realm; on condition only, that the said places remain for ever under the dominion of persia; and that in the future treaty of pacification between the ottoman porte and persia, her imperial majesty shall be therein comprised as a friend to both contracting parties. this is what relates to the affair of persia in general, and to the ottomans conduct with regard to the kingdom; by which it will appear, that the porte through her procedure alone, has drawn on herself this tedious and destructive war. on the other hand, the ottoman porte\\'s conduct towards russia, relatively to the persian affairs, has not at all differed from the violences and open hostilities exercised in this empire\\'s ancient provinces. notwithstanding her imperial majesty continued giving the porte proofs of her intentions; particularly her imperial majesty relieved and preserved ali basha ,185 who was with his troops reduced to the last extremity in ardebil;186 and after having delivered him thence, her imperial majesty, thro\\' a pure motive of generosity, caused his charges to be defrayed as far as astara, and convoyed to the very borders of turkey: she likewise ordered a kind reception to be given to several hundreds of turks, escaped from bondage in persia and usbec, caused them all to be plentifully entertained, and supplied them with whatever necessaries they wanted, and had them conducted with a good guard to their very homes. \\' 4.80 \\'vienna, april 14,\\' the boston evening-post (thursday, 8 august, 1737):

to obtain which, she had recourse to all sorts of methods and insinuations. she represented to him, that the formidable union between the emperor212 and russia might tend to pull down the ottoman power;213 and that in such a case, the other princes and states of asia might have great cause to dread the consequences of it: to these public reasons, private interest was join\\'d; offers were made to kouli kan to give him two or three provinces bordering on the conquests which were ceded to him by the last treaty of peace; there remained then but one thing which might have dash\\'d the negotiations to pieces, and that was some articles left undecided relating to the disputes between the turks and persians about the sects of omar and haly; but the porte, less scrupulous in those points than she used formerly to be, granted the persians all their demands on that head: this difficulty being thus got over, kouli kan considered the importance of the other two objects above-mentioned; upon which, he sent the embassador now here to treat about that affair; that minister has had frequent conferences with the kaimakan,214 and we are assured that every thing is almost

enemies might perhaps reduce the ottoman empire to great straits; and in such a case the other princes and states of asia would have reason to dread the consequences of it to themselves: they also offered to relinquish to kouli kan two or three provinces, bordering upon the conquests already yielded up to him, by the last treaty of peace. the only difficulty that remained was relating to the differences between the sects of omar and ali; but the turks urged on by the necessity of their affairs, have given up this article also, and granted thamas kouli kan the utmost of his demands. accordingly the new ambassador has had several conferences with the kaimakan,225 and it is assured the conditions of this cession are as good as agreed upon. it is added, that as soon as the treaty is perfected, thamas kouli kan is to furnish the porte with a powerful assistance of a hundred and sixty thousand men.\\' 4.98 \\'foreign affairs. london, october 6,\\' the new-york weekly journal

kouli kan, which we have inserted to shew the restless enterprising genius of that usurper. \"the last summer thamas kouli kan, or as he now is styled, schach nadir, being at the siege of candahar, an embassador arrived at his camp from the great mogul,238 with magnificent presents.239 the embassador met with a favourable reception, but at his departure kouli kan order\\'d him to declare to the great mogul, that about 200 years ago, schach thamas i.240 sent the mogul majan241 a succour of 12,000 men,242 whom contrary to agreement he retain\\'d in india, without ever suffering them to return. that nevertheless persia demanded all the descendants of the said 12,000 men to be immediately sent home, and that the great mogul do reimburse all the arrears due to the said 12,000 men for 200 years past, in default of which, persia will endeavour to do herself justice. but this demand being thought a little too exorbitant, he has since dispatch\\'d an embassador to the great mogul243 to mitigate his conditions a little, which are now, that if the mogul will pay him 120,000 persian rubels a year for 20 years, he will renounce all other pretensions upon this head. the indian monarch\\'s answer to these proposals is expected with impatience; if he does not fully comply with them, kouli kan is resolved to turn his conquering arms on that side, to which end he has already order\\'d magazines to be form\\'d upon the road. from candahar to cabul, the first frontier town of the mogul territories, is ten days march, and from thence to the residence of the great mogul, 40 days more.\"\\' 4.108

received at ispahan,244 and that he stays there for the return of kouli kan from candahar, to put the last hand to the treaty of peace, and to engage him to take arms against the christian princes: but we have other advices more to be depended on, which say, that ambassador is no better than a prisoner; that kouli kan does not think of ratifying what his minister did here with regard to peace; that he is upon the best of terms with russia, and that as soon as he has subdued the rebels, it will be visible, that he only pretended to enter into a negotiation with the porte, only to gain time for that purpose.\\' 4.109 \\'an extract of a private letter from paris,\\' the pennsylvania gazette (13-20 july, 1738) and \\'vienna, march 26,\\' the virginia gazette (friday-friday, 28 july-4

all their late letters from constantinople, the affairs of the porte are not in a situation so advantagious [sic] as to justify their haughty conduct. they say, that the example of the bashaw of babylon, has induced the inhabitants of natolia to revolt in like manner against the grand signior, and that troops have been sent against them, which were repulsed.\\' 4.113 \\'london, april 18,\\'

things, endeavours to take advantage of them to throw off the turkish yoke, and take upon him the sovereignty in his government. \\'tis also added, that there is even an agreement between him and thamas kouli kan. this conduct of the bashaw has excited the inhabitants of natolia to revolt against the grand signior, and that some troops which were order\\'d to march against them were repuls\\'d.\\' 4.115 \\'venice, may 26,\\' the boston evening-post (monday, 28 august, 1738): \\'all advices from constantinople & smyrna make it more and more apparent, that the grand seignior258 is assured of the alliance of thamas kouli kan, and that he is in no fear of kouli kan\\'s having enter\\'d into any contrary alliances: one circumstance which seems to prove it is, that the rest of the

in reality in a miserable condition, and the good circumstances of the russian army, and the vigorous march of count munich266 for some extraordinary enterprise, puts the porte into the utmost consternation: and what adds to their perplexity is, the advice they have, that thamas kouli kan, having at last taken candahar, and thereby finished the conquest of all persia, and composed all his differences with the motul [sic, mogul],267 and refusing to ratify several of the articles of peace lately agreed upon between him and the porte, \\'tis apprehended he intends once more to break with

only bringing the retification [sic, ratification] of the treaty of peace concluded last year, but are also charg\\'d to offer his persian majesty\\'s mediation for an accommodation with russia: but

last embassor [sic, embassador] he had sent to the porte, and likewise the grand signior\\'s embassador at ispahan, to repair to the army.276 on their arrival there the former was several times very severely cudgel\\'d by kouli kan\\'s orders, and that too in the presedce [sic, presence] of the turkish ambassador; after which they were brought into the schach\\'s tent: kouli-kan having ask\\'d the embassador what he had brought back from constantinople; he answer\\'d, that he had a letter to deliver to his highness from the grand seignior:277 to which the schach replied, if there had been nothing else to be done but barely receiving a letter, i might have sent some body else; but thou oughtest to have brought me entire satisfaction concerning my pretensions: at the same time he took the cane, with which he gave the embassador several heavy strokes more, without vouchsafing either to cast an eye on, or speak to the grand signior\\'s minister. he complain\\'d nevertheless of the several artifices employ\\'d by the porte, and said, that he had not kept the promise he had made him to restore the provinces dismembered from the persian empire, but that he was in a condition to procure himself justice, and that he would make no peace with the turks but upon the footing of the treaties concluded by abbas the great;278 that therefore he pretended that mecca should be possess\\'d in common by the persians as well as the turks, and the grand signior should restore all the persian subjects detained prisoners by him. kouli kan then sent orders to tauris, schirvan, erivan, and other places on the frontiers, to assemble as many troops as possibly they can, and hold them in readiness to march upon the first notice given. m. galowski adds, that he does not doubt but that schach nadir will quickly renew the war with the grand signior. \\'279 4.124 \\'london, july 8,\\' the virginia gazette (saturday, 27 october, 1738): \\'it is given out at petersburg, that

can\\'d. after which thamas kouli kan ask\\'d him what he had brought from constantinople, the ambassador answer\\'d, a letter from the grand signior; if, said the schach nadyr, there had been no other business than to have receiv\\'d a letter, i might have sent some other person than thee; but thou oughtest to have brought me an entire satisfaction to what i had demanded. at which he himself took a stick, and gave his ambassador several strokes, without vouchsafing to speak to the ambassador of the grand signior, or even look at him, he then took occasion to complain of many artifices made use of by the porte, and said, that she had not kept the promise she had made to restore him the provinces, dismembered from the kingdom of persia, but that he was in condition to do himself justice, and that he would make peace with the turks on no other footing than on that of the treaties concluded by abas the great; 284 which gave the persians a right to the possession of mecca in common with the turks, and that the grand signior should set at liberty all the subjects of persia which were prisoners in turkey. he afterwards sent orders to tauris and all the frontier places, to

the third embassador from thamas kouli kan, who is the chief of the embassy, arrived lately in the neighbourhood of constantinople, but the porte did not think proper to admit him into the city,310 because the reis effendi,311 whom the grand seignor312 had named to treat with him, was not then returned from the army. it is believed the ministers of the divan took that pretext, merely to gain time for receiving certain advice of the situation of affairs in hungary, and on the neister, that they might conduct themselves accordingly in their answer to the propositions of the persian embassador, which, we are assured, are not very agreeable to the porte. we hear further, that the ottoman court appears disposed to make up matters with the christian powers in war with her.\\' 4.138

persia, be demolished in presence of an inspector, appointed by kouli kan.\"327 the grand seignior having assembled a divan, on purpose to consider of these proposals, all the members declared unanimously, that kouli kan\\'s demands were so injurious to the grand seignior, that he cou\\'d do no less than renew the war against him, and that his highness was able enough at the same time to carry on the war against the christians. the grand vizier328 made a motion, for sending the ambassadors prisoners to the seven towers, in hopes of drawing from them what treaty their master has made with the czarina;329 but the grand seignior was against proceeding with such violence, and said it would be sufficient to send the ambassadors home with a message to kouli kan, that the porte chose rather to renew the war with him, than to accept any of his proposals. since this divan, the standard of mahomet330 has been erected in this city, which is a ceremony, whereby the turks are invited to

the negotiations between the two courts, and omits nothing in order to prevail upon thamas kouli kan to send an army towards the frontiers of russia. such dispositions suit well enough the warlike temper of that prince; besides which they seem requisite for his own security since thamaseb, the lawful king367 of persia, is still alive and beloved by the people, who wish to see him again on the throne of his ancestors. the nation of the lesguis , who are at war with him, have lately made an incursion into the north of persia and ravaged a great tract of land; upon which kouli kan has made very advantageous promises to the georgians, in order to engage them to take up arms against those people.368 the governor of this city [isfahan]369 gives out that thamas kouli kan has made himself master of cabou l , moultan 370 and kichmir 371 in the indies. that prince, in order to persuade the persians that he has some seal for religion, has ordered 200 mollas to be picked out of this city,

is thought to be aiming at the conquest of indostan; for after the victories he gain\\'d over the turks, and making peace with them, he return\\'d to ispahan, the capital of persia, where, after a short stay to settle the kingdom to his mind, he set out with a very numerous army for candahar, a frontier town belonging to the mogul,374 which by these people was thought impregnable (it\\'s the place where merriways, that plunder\\'d ispahan about 12 years ago, carried the riches of persia) but the schach nadir took it at one assault,375 razed all the fortifications, and built a new wall round it, and strong forts, and calls it nadirabad.376 he has since taken cabull,377 another very strong place, and the only one that can hinder his march to delhi, where the mogul keeps his court. he has not yet taken the castle of cabull, but we expect to hear the news of its surrender daily, for he is making preparations for the march of his army to the province of multan, which is the road to delhi. notwithstanding these great successes, the mogul does not seem inclinable to meet him himself, nor send any of his generals with an army to oppose him, tho\\' he certainly can raise a multitude of people, moors and tartars only, besides the forces of the gentoo378 rajahs, who are tributary to him, and four or five of them capable of sending him 200,000 men each; but such is the case, the kingdom for several years past has been in a distracted state, occasion\\'d first by the omrah\\'s379 jealousies of each other\\'s greatness, which led them to indulge the mogul with women, and every thing that tended to luxury, to give them an opportunity the better to pursue their separate interests; which management of the courtiers in a short time encouraged the gentoo princes to play their game in turn, and sometimes one, and sometimes another, disputed paying their tributes, which has given a deal of trouble to the mogul to keep them in tolerable order; and it\\'s believ\\'d, if they take it in their heads to oppose thamas kouli kan, by the time they could all agree to unite their forces, he would reach delhi; and if so, his judgment in war so far exceeds the best of the mogul\\'s generals, and his men being so much superior in courage and strength to any in those parts, it\\'s more than probable he\\'d shortly have it in his option to sit on the throne of indostan or persia.

able to resist that conqueror, especially in the present melancholly state of affairs in mogul; that the omarans or grandees of his kingdom were divided, that they had rendered themselves in a manner independent; and that having by that means so many opposite interests, a speedy revolution was expected; which seems to be more certain, because kouli-kan has nothing to fear from the great mogul, who

1st, because almost all the janissaries, several of whom he has put to death have vow\\'d his destruction; 2dly, because the affairs of the empire are not yet well settled and \\'tis fear\\'d that schach nadir is canvassing some new expedition.\\' 4.205 \\'ispahan , march 2,\\' the american weekly mercury (thursday-thursday, 20-27 november, 1740) and \\'ispahan , march 2,\\' the new england weekly journal (tuesday, 6 january, 1741), and with minor variations, beginning at \\'the elephants\\', \\'from persia, the new-papers give us the following valuation of the booty which thamas kouli kan brought away from the moguls country,\\' the new-jersey journal, and political intelligencer (wednesday, 1 april, 1789), \\'philadelphia, march 25,\\' the middlesex gazette, or, federal adviser (saturday, 4 april, 1789), \\'pennsylvania. philadelphia, march 26,\\' the massachusetts spy (thursday, 9 april, 1789) and \\'from persia, the new-papers give us the following valuation of the booty which thamas kouli kan brought away from the mogul\\'s country,\\' the berkshire chronicle (friday, 17 april, 1789): \\'thamas kouli kan did not return from his expedition against the great mogul473 till last month [february]. his treaty with that prince has lately been published, wherein the mogul expresses himself in the following manner: the grand schach nadir having sent an ambassador474 to me, i did all in my power to dispatch him; but my ministers rather desiring to raise a misunderstanding between the two empires than to do what i directed, postpon\\'d giving an answer to, and retarded the ambassador: this was the cause that the schach nadir, grown impatient at his ambassador\\'s not returning, came into my dominions. we engaged there, he became victorious, and fortune to such a degree favoured him, as to render him master of my empire. he entered dely , secur\\'d my person, and took possession of all my treasures. he required me to give him a state of my revenues; but the schach nadir having promis\\'d to re establish me upon my throne, i declared him sovereign of all the countries and dominions from candahar to the river indus.475 the following is a valuation of the booty which thamas kouli kan brought away from the mogul\\'s country. the elephants, camels, artillery, tents, and ammunition, taken in the different actions, are valued at 75,000,000 millions of livres; 375,000,000 l. were taken out of the imperial treasures; jewels and precious stones to the value, of 200,000,000 l the emperor\\'s bed of state 175,000,000 l. an imperial throne set with diamonds 225,000,000 l. plate set with precious stones 275,000,000 l. money and jewels taken from the emperor\\'s wives and children 755,000,000 l. the plunder of the city of dely 250,000,000 l. contributions raised upon the inhabitants 250,000,000 l. from the great men of the empire 250,000,000 l. from the two grand favourites of the emperor 400,000,000 l. and from the estates of the ministers and favourites of the great mogul, who were put to death at the desire of thamas kouli kan; the whole amounting to 2,775,000,000 l.476 more riches than the greatest part of this were brought from the city of dely alone. people would with difficulty believe what is above-related, was it not that the riches of indostan were well known, and that its manufactures and produce brought in every year vast sums, both from asia and europe, which scarce ever go out again. thamas kouli kan has likewise impos\\'d on the great mogul an annual tribute of 75,000,000 l. and has setled [sic] the annual expense of the court of that prince at 110,000,000 l. the ill government of the empire of the mogul has been the occasion of this sudden revolution, such a one as no history can produce. the people groaned under the oppression of the grandees. the emperor, a prince of a weak mind, and wholly taken up in the pursuit of his pleasures, left the care of the empire to two favourites, who aimed at nothing so much as the amassing of treasure. the dominions were naked of troops, because the generals, whose business it was to have kept them on foot, appropriated the sums designed for that purpose to their own use. some rebels from the neighbourhood of malebar and coromandel penetrated even into indostan, and the little resistance that they met with discovered how easy it would be to evade this empire. whilst thamas kouli kan extended his conquests with an army of 80,000 horse, and 20,000 foot, well arm\\'d and disciplin\\'d, with 250 pieces of cannon, the mogul was in a state of security at dely, imagining he had done enough in gathering together an army of 200,000 horse, and 500,000 foot, with 5000 arm\\'d elephants, and 8000 pieces of cannon, but which were rais\\'d in a hurry, and all military stores wanting. the battle of the 22d of feb. 1739, which cost the lives of 100,000 men, and a part of the emperor\\'s family, at once determined the fate of the prince, and secur\\'d the empire to thamas kouli kan, who restor\\'d it to the mogul by virtue of the above-mentioned treaty. during the continuance thamas kouli kan at dely, he caus\\'d money to be coin\\'d there with the following inscription, schach nadir was born to be the emperor of the world. he is the king of kings.477 4.206 \\'venice, august 16,\\' the american weekly mercury (thursday-thursday, 4-11 december, 1740): \\'we have letters from constantinople, which say, that the alarm there is so great, upon account of the motions which the sophia of persia has directed to be made towards erzerum and babylon, that a general revolt was expected every day, for strangling the kislar aga of the eunuchs,478 and deposing the grand signior479 himself, in order to restore his brother achmet480 to the crown.\\' 4.207 \\'untitled,\\' the boston evening-post (monday, 15 december, 1740) and \\'untitled,\\' the american weekly mercury (thursday-thursday, 15-22 january, 1741): \\'letters from venice say, that they have received positive advice, that schach nadir arrived at ispahan in the month of march last;

the generals succeeded in securing part of the troops in the young prince\\'s interest, and so an open revolt ensued in favour of the son against the father.6 the rest of the army, which remain\\'d attach\\'d to the father, attack\\'d the rebels with so much advantage, that they were defeated, and their generals taken prisoners, along with the prince for whom they rose up in arms against their sovereign. thamas kouli kan, who did all that could be expected from a great captain as well as a soldier during the engagement, had his hand pierc\\'d by a musket bullet.7 a few days after he order\\'d his eldest son to be brought before him, reproach\\'d him with his rebellion, and his attempt against his life, and then condemn\\'d him to death.8 as to the generals who sided with the son, some of them were impaled, others had their eyes, put out, their tongues torn up by the root, &c. as the common soldiers could not all be punished, they were decimated. according to these advices kouli kan only waits the return of his embassador, in order to take a final resolution as to peace or war with the port. kouli kan is a very tall well built man,9 takes great pains to obtain european officers to discipline his soldiers, and intends to put his troops upon the same footing with the europeans. he is of a brisk enterprizing temper, always forming vast projects, and executes them almost as soon as they are conceived. his voice is so strong, that one may hear him speak distinctly at the distance of 300 yards, when he speaks loud without straining himself.\\' 5.3 \\'extract of a letter from pera, near constantinople, dated jan. 11,\\' the new england weekly journal (tuesday, 28 april, 1741): \\'the news of the death of the empress of russia10 coming so soon after that of the emperor of the romans,11 occasion\\'d great agitations in the divan, in which there are two parties;

but he answer\\'d, \"that his order was to shew it to none but the grand signior38 himself.\" after some little conversation the persian made a signal, and all his retinue arose, which the turks reckon a great piece of rudeness; and upon going away they doff\\'d their caffetans, and return\\'d them to the grand vizir\\'s domesticks. the motive of his embassy is pretty well guess\\'d at: it is said he has orders \"to demand of the porte, restitution of all the provinces which formerly belong\\'d to persia, and that the persians, may have as much power hereafter at mecca as the turks have:\"39 but we shall soon know more of the matter, because to-morrow the ambassador is to be introduc\\'d to an audience of the grand signior. be it as it will, \\'tis said his highness intends to grant neither of those two articles, in case the minister should propose them; but rather to venture the fate of another rupture. at least certain it is, that great preparations are actually making to guard against any surprize: and besides 30 companies of janisaries already sent off to asia, and 30 more that will be soon going thither, orders are given to all the governours of the empire, to muster all the forces they can in their several jurisdictions. moreover, guards are plac\\'d at all the avenues that lead to the persian ambassador\\'s lodgings, on pretence indeed of doing him honour, but in reality to watch who passes in or out, and in particular whether he has any correspondence with the ambassador of russia:40 so that there\\'s more appearance than ever of a fresh war betwixt the grand signior and the sophi of persia, whose demands are like to be as haughty, as the behaviour of his ambassador is insolent.\\' 5.13 \\'petersburgh, may 2,\\' the new england weekly journal (tuesday, 21 july, 1741): \\'general romanzoff our [russian] ambassador at the porte41 says they are extreamly embarrass\\'d on account of the affairs of persia, and that the new ambassador42 from kouli kan behaves with [?...] arrogance, and has a commission to make extraordinary demands of the grand signior.\\' 5.14 \\'from the london magazine for may, 1741,\\' the boston evening-post (monday, 17 august, 1741): \\'the swedes seem bent upon a war with russia...the muscovites ...probably would be more than a match for the swedes;

but in spite of all his efforts to obtain it, the porte remain\\'d unshakable; so that he resolv\\'d to see the grand vizir only for form\\'s sake, being fully determined not to talk with him about any business before he had seen the grand signior.47 after he had been conducted to the hall of audience, he sat down by the prime minister, and made three gentlemen of his retinue sit down on the same sopha, to whom pipes and tobacco were presented. according to custom, the ambassador was presented with a pelisse, but he would not wear it, and gave it to a slave to keep: his retinue also refused the caffans [sic, caftans] that were presented to them. the grand vizir having touch\\'d upon some points concerning the affairs of the two empires, the ambassador made him no answer, but waved the discourse to general affairs, and in particular expatiated on the valour, the conquests and victories of thamas kouli kan, and so ended his visit. the ambassador behav\\'d with the same haughtiness at the audience he had a few days after of the grand signior,48 and demanded in express terms, the restitution of the ancient frontiers of the persian empire; adding, that the sophi his master, pretended to as much authority at mecca as the ottoman emperor. he was told that he should have an answer in proper time and place.49 since this audience several divans have been held, in which, \\'tis said, war has been resolv\\'d upon, rather than grant any of the persian ambassador\\'s demands. in the mean time several chambers of janissaries are filing off to asia, and orders have been issued for assembling the spahis, and getting ready great trains of artillery, with all sorts of provision and ammunition. the porte appears extremely embarrassed with the new war with which she is threatened: it is fear\\'d that the first defeat may occasion the deposing of the sultan, in order to place an emperor on the throne that may command his armies in person. however, we flatter ourselves that the persian minister, whom we expect in a few days, is charg\\'d with more agreeable proposals.\\' 5.16 \\'constantinople, may 30,\\' new england weekly journal (friday, 15 september, 1741) and \\'constantinople, may 30,\\' the pennsylvania gazette (8 october, 1741): \\'tho\\' the ambassador50 from the sophy of persia is very much carress\\'d by the porte, \\'tis still said that the persians have form\\'d the seige [sic] of kars51 and balsora .\\'52 5.17 \\'leghorn, july 1. n.s. ,\\' new england weekly journal (tuesday, 15 september, 1741) and \\'leghorn, july 1. n.s. ,\\' the pennsylvania gazette (8 october, 1741): \\'letters from constantinople say, that kouli kan was on the march with a numerous army to attack the daghestan tartars,53 whose country lyes between the caspian sea, persia, and the circassians, who are subjects of russia;

and he concluded his discourse in the manner following: these two articles have equity for their foundation, and are of such a nature that they may be granted without hesitation; otherwise the emperor my master will be obliged to support his rights by a numerous army. the grand signior sent him word, that he should have an answer to his proposals in due time; and we hear that several divans have been held, in which it was resolved to make war, rather than consent to those demands. mean time a good body of janizaries is order\\'d to asia, to re-inforce those already sent thither, and there\\'s a talk of getting the horse and necessary ammunition ready: and yet for all this, the porte flatter themselves that the second ambassador who is shortly expected here from kouli kan, will have it in commission to make proposals more acceptable & more likely to maintain a peace. which would be very agreeable to the grand signior\\'s ministers; because they seem to have some other enterprize in their heads, if we may be allow\\'d to guess so from the equipment of twelve sultanas, or ships of the line,61 twelve galleys,62 and twenty-four galliots.\\'63 5.20 \\'extract of another letter from constantinople, of may 15 n.s. ,\\' new england weekly journal (tuesday, 13 october, 1741): \\'we have receiv\\'d advice of a disturbance that has happen\\'d at mecca, which will probably be the cause of a bloody war between the grand signior64 and kouli kan. a persian caravan arriving at mecca, with several pilgrims, laden with presents for mahomet\\'s tomb, they bribed the xeriff, or high priest there,65 who gave them leave to place them upon it: which being what is never granted to any but the mussulmen, and the persians being reputed schismaticks, the xeriff\\'s brother, a wicked man, and one who aimed at his post, took that opportunity to raise the mob, who being commonly fond of riots ran in a fury to the xeriff\\'s house, and inhumanly murder\\'d him, and all the persians of the caravan,66 after having scatter\\'d all their presents abroad, and trampled them under foot. we are assur\\'d that when kouli kan67 was inform\\'d of this news, he immediately sent two great detachments from his army, one to bassora and the other to karz ,68 so that a war seems unavoidable. the grand signior upon this immediately sent away ten more chambers of janizaries for asia, with ammunition and provisions. the arabs have also put themselves in motion, but whether for or against kouli kan is not known. \\'tis said that four kans, or princes, of persia have enter\\'d into a league against kouli kan, and put 50000 of his men to flight; but \\'tis suspected that this last article is groundless, and only publish\\'d to prevent the populace from taking an alarm, and making a commotion, when they hear what has pass\\'d at mecca, and what measures kouli kan has taken to obtain satisfaction. mean time the porte highly caresses the persian, and all the foreign ministers also who reside here on the part of the european powers.\\' 5.21 \\'london, june 30,\\' new england weekly journal (tuesday, 13 october, 1741): \\'there\\'s advice from constantinople by way of vienna, that kouli kan has sent 200000 men towards bassora, and that another army was on the march towards mecca, to take vengeance for the murder of 400 persian pilgrims, who went to visit mahomet\\'s tomb which is news that very much confounds the divan.\\' 5.22 \\'rome, july 15,\\' the pennsylvania gazette (thursday, 15 october, 1741): \\'the congregation of propaganda fide received advice the 10th instant, that thamas kouli kan had ordered all christians of his dominions, as well catholicks as schismaticks, to translate into the persian language the pentateuch, the psalms, isaiah, and the four evangelists.\\'69 5.23 \\'london, july 29,\\' new england weekly journal (tuesday, 20 october, 1741): \\'letters of the 4th inst.

but this report was soon destroyed by the assurance given by the persian embassador,73 that the schach his master, did not give the least countenance to the rebellion. it is certain, that the ministers of both powers, labour seriously to restore a good harmony between them: some people even pretend, that the treaty is actually concluded, and only wants to be ratified. whatever the matter may be, we find that the persian embassador, is treated with greater marks of distinction, than any of his predecessors ever were.\\' 5.25 \\'extracts of a private letter from the hague, aug. 1. 1741,\\' the boston gazette (tuesday, 10 november, 1741) and \\'hague, august 21,\\' the new-york weekly journal (monday, 14 december, 1741): \\'a person who went hence in the train of mr. kalkoen to constantinople,74 and is lately return\\'d, reports strange things of shah nadir, heretofore kouli kan;

an expedient which would be much ridicul\\'d by the european powers. if it be with truth reported, that he has now three armies on the march to invade turkey, his forces, if he has left garrisons in the indies, must not be less numerous than those of his predecessor xerxes, nor will his territories, if this expedition proves successful, be less extensive. great events may reasonably be expected from a man of capacity so exalted, that it enables him in the midst of wars and conquests, to attend to plans of a very different kind; which kouli kan discovers, by having, as it is reported, called together all the learned christians from all parts of his dominions, to translate some select books of the holy scriptures. the neighbourhood of such a monarch must necessarily hold the turks in continual terrors, especially as he has claims on his territories, and it is not likely, that a man of his character will lose any of his rights by negligence or cowardice. russia is at this juncture courted by both the mahometan monarchs with respect perhaps never paid to any christian power before;

that the rebels or malecontents had settled a correspondence with the great mogul; and that the latter readily came into their measures, and engaged to second them with all his power, in hopes of being revenged on the persian monarch. the following are the conditions of peace proposed by kouli kan, and by comparing them with those offer\\'d last year, one may easily judge that he is drove to great extremities. thamas kouli kan insists no longer on the restitution of the conquests which the turks made in persia during the usurpation of miriweis and eschreff. in order to put an end at once to all the difficulties about the limits of both empires, he consents to draw a line from the caspian sea to the persian gulph, which shall reach from ardebil to the province of chusistan, including bagdad and its territory, by which division the grand signor141 remains in possession of all that he formerly conquer\\'d in persia. kouli kan renounces the right he pretends to in regard to the pilgrimages to mecca, and the visiting of mahomet\\'s tomb. he promises not to contract any alliance prejudicial to the porte, and to grant to the grand signor\\'s subjects great advantages in their trade to persia. in fine, he desires a new congress may be appointed for settling the other conditions of the accomodations, and signing the definitive treaty. a divan has already been held on these proposals, and another is to be held tomorrow, in which it is likely that a final resolution will be taken. in the mean time we are informed, that the porte intends to improve this conjuncture, by detaching kouli kan from his alliance with russia, or at least to prevent his leaguing with that crown for the future, in prejudice of the porte.\\' 5.58 \\'hambourg, sept. 5,\\' the american weekly mercury (thursday-thursday, 18 november-2 december, 1742): \\'they write from petersbourg, that thamas kouli kan has declared war against the grand signor,142 that his troops were marching towards erzerum, and that hostilities are actually begun.\\' 5.59 \\'constantinople, july 12,\\' the pennsylvania gazette (30 december, 1742): \\'the new grand vizir143 has frequent conferences with count bonneval, who is his oracle as to foreign affairs;

on condition they raise and pay 10,000 men for his service. he likewise subdued three princes of daghestan,144 and is at present at derbent. very lately he detached a principal officer of his army with 60,000 men into the plains of ponga.145 these motions create inexpressible uneasiness here, and much scheming among the ministers.\\' 5.60 \\'constantinople, august 4,\\' the new-york weekly journal (monday, 2 january, 1743): \\'some people here [constantinople] were desirous that the grand standard of mahomet should be exposed;

besides which he has drawn out all the garrisons in romelia,307 and on the frontiers of poland and hungary, and ordered them to file off to the camp that is forming at salonica, where they are to remain until they can be transported to natolia.\\' 5.121 \\'london, october 5,\\' the boston evening-post (monday, 13 february, 1744): \\'letters from constantinople advise, that the grand vizir has put off his departure for asia, whither the ottoman troops continue to file off, in expectation of an answer from schach nadir to some new proposals that have been made him;

which being in no posture of defence, cannot hold out long.318 another body of his troops arrived, the day the post came away, within one day\\'s march of the city of babylon; in which, there is great reason to believe he has a very strong party. we much doubt, whether the very next advices will not bring us the news of his having possess\\'d himself of the rich province of diarbeck, between the tygris and the euphrates. our [ottoman] project of engaging the curdes has failed us. all this ill news coming together, might well work upon the minds of people so much inclined to sedition, as the inhabitants of this city are known to be, but the news of an additional mischief, greater than all the rest, had well nigh swell\\'d their murmurs into an open revolt. the kingdom of egypt is divided into several governments, each under its respective prince, who is stiled the bey. the present basha of grand cairo has attempted to circumscribe the authority of these beys,319 which gave them such offence, as occasion\\'d their taking arms, surprizing the city of cairo, and making the basha prisoner.320 it has been tho\\'t necessary, upon this, to send away two men of war, with 600 soldiers each, to alexandria.321 all our hope at present lie on the new shah of persia, who is now here,322 and who is asserted to be the lawful heir of the late shah, deposed by meriweis. the grand seignor323 has ordered a rich crown to be made for him,324 his seraglio is already formed,325 and he is to be conducted into persia with an army of 70,000 regular troops.\\'326 5.126 \\'warsaw, oct 28,\\' the boston weekly news-letter (thursday, 1 march, 1744): \\'according to our last advices from constantinople, the affairs of that empire are in a dreadful confusion; the shah nadir having advanced almost to the banks of the euphrates, found a turkish army in his way, assembled for the protection of the great province of diarbeck; one of the most considerable, in point of profit, within their dominions. he immediately made the necessary dispositions for attacking them; and though their foot made an obstinate resistance, yet their horse being beat at the first charge, they were at last obliged to give way, and were finally defeated with a great slaughter. by this victory, the shah posses [sic, possesses] all the flat country; that is, all the antients call\\'d mesopotamia, babylonia, and chaldea; and when the news arriv\\'d at constantinople, he was tho\\'t to have pass\\'d the euphrates.\\' 5.127 \\'extract of a letter from constantinople, dated sept. 4 [1743],\\' the boston evening-post (monday, 5 march, 1744): \\'the turkish troops are filing off from all parts to asia with the utmost diligence. a considerable army is already formed in natolia, and we hear that the persian lord,327 of whom we lately made mention, has been declared sophi of persia at the head of that army, as the nearest relation and lawful heir of the old sophi, schach abbas.328 this step cannot fail of making the two nations irreconcileable, and the consequences of it must be a long and bloody war, the porte having at the same time declared, that she never will acknowledge thamas kouli kan for sophi of persia. it is pretended, that the grand signor329 did not take this step but upon advice, that schach nadir had rejected all the proposals made to him for an accomodation, and that he insists upon the restitution of all the provinces taken from persia since the death of schach abbas the great330... .the porte has just received several couriers from the frontiers of persia, whose dispatches occasioned many long and warm debates in the divan. achmet bashaw, who was grand vizir 18 months ago,331 is appointed seraskier in chief, or general in chief, of the ottoman forces, and orders have been sent to him at rhodes, where he lived in exile, to set out forthwith for asia, and put himself at the head of the army there.332 the persian prince333 was to take the same route very speedily,334 and be escorted by a large body of troops. it is said, that the thing which has hindered the grand vizir335 from commanding the army, is, that he insisted upon displaying mahomet\\'s standard, which the divan does not judge proper at present, besides, they say, his presence is necessary at constantinople, to keep the people in order, who seem to be ripe for a revolt.\\' 5.128 \\'london, december 13,\\' the new-york weekly post-boy (26 march, 1744): \\'we learn by private letters from hamburgh, that certain intelligence has been receiv\\'d from derbent, that thamas kouli kan has ordered a considerable fleet to be equipp\\'d instantly on the caspian sea.\\'336 5.129 \\'constantinople, october 28 [1743],\\' the american weekly mercury (30 march-5 april, 1744): \\'the affairs of the count de bonneval, known here by the name of osman bashaw, have been restor\\'d and ruin\\'d again in less than a fortnight. the grand signor337 finding himself much pressed by the shah nadir, had resolv\\'d to hold a grand council of war, in order to determine what course to take; in which he was desirous of having the advice of osman bashaw. at this divan, c. bonneval produced a scheme which, he asserted, would put an end to the war in one campaign; but upon examination, the bashaw understood so little of it, that they resolv\\'d to declare it impracticable, in order to be rid of it; upon which, osman bashaw was directed to retire to his country seat, from whence he came; and it is conceived his advice will never be ask\\'d more... . our court has heretofore been as remarkable for refined strokes of policy as any other in europe; and tho\\' it is certain that our affairs were never so much embarras\\'d as at present, yet the steps taken in favour of the late grand vizir, ali ogii,338 manifest at once the wisdom and firmness of the sultan. the janizaries had shewed such an aversion to that great minister, as render\\'d it very apparent that they would never do their duty while he was at the helm. this was the only motive which induced his sublime highness to depose him; as the putting the janzaries in a good humour was the single reason why their aga, hassan bashaw,339 was made prime vizir. as soon as this point was carried, orders were sent to the late vizir,340 who, upon his deposition, was exil\\'d to metelino,341 to repair to aleppo, whither, after his removal, a great body of troops had march\\'d, tho\\' they refused to do it before. the intent of his going thither is, that he may be at hand either to negociate a peace with the shah nadir, if that should be practicable, or to command the army in chief, in case, after all our endeavours to the contrary, we should be forced into a war. in the mean time, shah nadir proceeds with his usual rapidity; for, without staying to reduce bagdad, the bashaw of which,342 tho\\' he rejected his summons, is suspected to be in his interest, he proceeded to attack kirkut, which he soon reduc\\'d, and then marching through the territory of mosul, which stands near the ancient nineveh,343 and the province of diarbeck, he seems to have in view the making himself master of aleppo. to frustrate this design, we are preparing to send all the troops that can be spared from europe; and to prevent their conferring with the malecontents here, they are to be transported directly to aleppo, under the convoy of a strong squadron of men of war that are now equipping. the rebellion in egypt continues to increase, and we have besides, the mortification of hearing that a body of 10,000 arabs are in arms near balsora.344 the squadron of galleys that sailed lately to asoph, are returned hither; and, it is said, will be employ\\'d in embarking troops for asia. \\' 5.130 \\'from the gentleman\\'s magazine for december, 1743. turkey,\\' the american weekly mercury (sunday-sunday, 5-12 april, 1744): \\'various accounts are publish\\'d at constantinople, some on purpose to conceal the progress of the persians on the frontiers; insinuating, that they had been repuls\\'d at mosul, by springing a mine.345 but the latest dated nov. 16 say, that when the shah took kirkut, he put the garrison and inhabitants to the sword, for having given him the trouble of a second assault; that he had defeated 50,000 turks who came to relieve it, for which reasons the city of mosul had submitted to his mercy. and the porte fears, that the schah has not only obtained an interest among the arab princes, but with the people of egypt, and even with some of the bashaws; since in return for their setting up the persian prince, he has declared, that he would soon shew he had an equal right of making a grand signior. the schah having since block\\'d up bagdad, a treaty was begun,346 on a proposal to restore the provinces conquer\\'d from persia.\\' 5.131 \\'constantinople, january 7,\\' the american weekly mercury (19-26 april, 1744): \\'the silence observed by the port on the subject of persia, since the raising of the siege of mosul, occasion\\'d a suspicion that things did not go altogether so well as had been reported. we have been since informed that this conjecture is but too well grounded; and that, instead of shah nadir\\'s abandoning his conquests, and retiring into persia, as was given out here,347 he has actually besieged babylon in form, and has, for several months, kept it quite blocked up. this ill news is attended with the following circumstances. the forces that had been repulsed at mosul having joined his army at kirkut, he march\\'d immediately with all his forces to the camp before babylon; where he found his army, with the forces he brought with him, about 150,000 strong; with which body he determined to push the siege with all imaginable vigour. he then marched with 30,000 light-armed troops to visit the tomb of the prophet ali,348 which is but two days journey from babylon; whence it was conjectured, that he intended to move on towards mecca; but of a sudden he altered his march, and with that corps of troops possessed himself of the strong pass of sigiria;349 the only one, by which it is possible for the turkish troops to attempt the relief of babylon. he has, besides, 40 or 50,000 men at kirkut and ervel, where he has provided large magazines and furnished them abundantly. the porte was in hopes that the proclaiming shah rade,350 descended from the old race of persian princes, would have had a good effect, and have drawn numbers of people in the frontier provinces to revolt; but we have been deceived in our notions, shah nadir is more firmly seated on the throne than ever; and we are now not a little fearful that his nephew,351 who is coming out of persia with a great reinforcement, will seize the person of the pretended shah we [turkey] have set up. this moment we have receiv\\'d advice, that babylon is not only block\\'d up, but reduced to a very large degree of extremity.352 if it should fall into the hands of the persians, we shall then have no other places of consequence in that part of the world, except the fortress of mosul and the city of bastra , both of which are at present blocked up by the troops of the shah.353 the seraskier of dierbeckir, who had orders to march to the relief of mosul, found that impracticable, on account of the superior forces that he found block\\'d up his passage.354 such is the present scituation of things; perhaps we shall speedily receive the news of this city\\'s having surrender\\'d, which must be attended with very fatal consequence here [constantinople], where the minds of the people are in a manner ripe for rebellion.\\' 5.132 \\'constantinople, jan. 12,\\' the american weekly mercury (sunday-sunday, 19-26 april, 1744): \\'it has been no longer practicable to conceal from the publick the distressed condition in which the city of bagdad now is, notwithstanding all the reports that have been published of the success of our troops against the persians. this ill news roused all our malecontents, who immediately began to talk not only of changing the ministry, but of deposing the grand signior;355 in the end however means have been found to quiet these tumults. council upon council has been held, and in the last it was resolv\\'d, that the grand vizir356 should immediately put himself at the army, in order to march directly and raise the siege of bagdad. we are however very apprehensive, that he must come too late; and that he will become a victim to this unfortunate war. all the principal officers of the several different corps have orders to march from their respective quarters in order to reach the place of general rendezvous in mesopotamia.\\' 5.133 \\'london, feb. 28,\\' the boston weekly post-boy (monday, 23 april, 1744): \\'letters directly from constantinople say, that their hopes of dethroning the persian usurper (by means of the young schach rade,357 descended from the ancient sophies of persia) were entirely vanished; he being more respected, and established on the throne than ever. babylon was reduced to the greatest extremity, and if that should fall into the hands of the persians, the turks will have nothing left in those quarters, but the fortress of mosul and the town of bastra,358 which likewise they cant hold long, being both block\\'d up by kouli kan\\'s troops;

and on the 8th, which was friday, at 10 o\\'clock, he threw an infinite number of bombs from twelve batteries against it, continuing night and day, when the besieg\\'d had great difficulty to save the advanc\\'d works from the execution of the bombs, persisting, with incredible courage in the defence, by firing continually against the assailants, which fire on both sides lasted eight day and eight nights, and the bombs thrown against the place were counted upwards of seventy thousand,373 beside the continual firing of the muskets. after this he caus\\'d the river tigris to be cut off in the neighbourhood of a place called cara sarai,374 and to be turn\\'d into the other channel;375 he press\\'d the besieg\\'d continually with numbers of his troops, who not in the least abating in their courage, both i and the governour of aleppo, his excellency hussein pascia,376 with a military example, incessantly animated the garrison, and closely attended the repairing of those parts that had been ruin\\'d by the cannon of the enemy, who having form\\'d mines, and in eight days time provided all sorts of instruments, especially 1700 ladders, which he made his soldiers carry upon their shoulders for the assault;377 and having pass\\'d the tigris with all his troops to apply the said scales to the walls, in the mean time he set fire to the mines, two of which by mere providence, turning backwards, buried a great number of their men,378 and the rest of the mines remain\\'d without the least operation; notwithstanding which, he forced his troops to the assault, and to apply the ladders. but the besieged were as active in repelling them with granadoes, bombs, and fire-arms, making a continual slaughter of the impertinent enemies: the fight between the two parties lasted seven hours, it being friday, after which, at about the eighth hour, our troops had the success, by the particular providence of the just god, to get the better, and to remain conquerors, having cut off 5400 enemies, and the remainder of their troops not being any longer able to withstand the heroick courage of our victorious soldiers, were forced to fly and retire to their camp; while we had but 40 in all of our men kill\\'d during the whole time of this siege and action. in short, all the projects contriv\\'d from the beginning by the perfidious enemy prov\\'d but vain attempts, so that growing at last desperate, with the greatest confusion and dispersion of his troops, not being able any longer to subsist in these parts, he in haste repass\\'d the river dizzle ,379 and retir\\'d to his own country. which being to be ascrib\\'d to god\\'s special favour, and to the august fortune of our invincible monarch, we are oblig\\'d to continual prayers that the divine majesty may be pleas\\'d to perpetuate his imperial triumphs.\\' 5.140 \\'constantinople, feb. 23,\\' the pennsylvania gazette (19 july, 1744): \\'the advices published by our ministry here [constantinople], are not to be depended on;

or to purchase a neutrality from them, by the distribution of money amongst the heads of the malecontents: but the janissaries seized on the money as soon as mentioned, remaining firm in their resolution to march hither.385 this, with the news that kouli kan is in full march to besiege erzerum, and that his eldest son has blocked up kars,386 has thrown the grand seignior and the ministry into great perplexity.\\' 5.147 \\'astracan , in persia, july 15,\\' the new-york weekly post-boy (29 october, 1744), \\'astracan, july 15,\\' the pennsylvania gazette (1 november, 1744), \\'astracan, (in persia) july 15,\\' the boston evening-post (monday, 26 november, 1744) and \\'astracan, (in persia) july 15,\\' the boston gazette, or, weekly journal (friday, 11 december): \\'an english company of merchants, established within these two years in russia, sent capt. elton with a considerable sum of money into persia;

that his army is divided into three bodies, one of which is commanded by himself in person, the second by his son,392 and the other by one of his generals, that these three corps make together upwards of 200,000 men, and that it was very much feared they would give battle to the ottoman army, before the bashaw of babylon393 could be in a condition to reinforce it.\\' 5.151 \\'constantinople, october 1,\\' the boston gazette, or weekly journal (tuesday, 8 january, 1745): \\'the grand signior394 has caused the following important piece of news to be notified in form to all the ministers that are here from foreign courts, and has likewise order\\'d prodigious rejoycings to be made, not only in the seraglio, but all over the city upon this occasion. this extraordinary news is contained in the following note \"the shah thomas, our inveterate enemy, having attack\\'d the forces intrench\\'d under the cannon of cars,395 those troops, sustained by the garrison of the place, not only repuls\\'d them with great loss, but obliged them likewise to retire, in the utmost confusion, four miles from their camp, making a continual slaughter of them all the way. the persians, however judging that the rich booty they had left in their camp must necessarily induce the victors to spread themselves all over it, were persuaded by their generals, to return, some hours after, to the charge; in hopes of profiting, by the supposed confusion; but our army received them so gallantly, that they were oblig\\'d a second time to retire, with the loss of 12,000 men. both engagements were very obstinate and bloody, insomuch that this victory has cost 9 or 10,000 men kill\\'d and wounded, and 3 basha\\'s slain upon the spot. the court flatters itself that this message, and the rejoycings made in the seraglio, will impose upon the people, and prevent their guessing at the truth, which, however, is far eno\\' from the matter of fact; for it is very well known here, that the shah nadir, on the 15th of aug. last, attack\\'d & defeated, the seraskier achmet basha,396 with the loss of about 3000 men. the army of the shah consisted of 150,000 men; the seraskier had 75,000, and was posted in a very strong camp, fortified with 135 pieces of cannon; notwithstanding which, and a reinforcement of 3000 men from diarbeck, he lost above 19 000 men, and was obliged to throw himself into kars with the remainder of his forces.397 it is believed that the shah has, by this time, form\\'d the seige of that city; the news of which, whenever it arrives, will probably induce a revolution here, while the people in general are in the highest degree discontented; and in the midst of their rejoycings it is known, that several of the principal ministers caus\\'d their most valuable effects to be withdrawn out of the seraglio, in order to their being sent to several islands in the archepelago, that they may be safe, let affairs take what turn they will. \\' 5.152 \\'hambourg, sept. 15 [1744],\\' the boston evening-post (monday, 14 january, 1745) and \\'hambourg, sept. 15,\\' the pennsylvania journal, or weekly advertiser (12 february, 1745): \\'the last letters from moscow say, that, notwithstanding the assurances of friendship and good neighbourhood with [sic, which] schach nadir renews from time to time to that court, they don\\'t at all depend on his sincerity, but have sent orders to the governors of astracan and derbent398 to be upon their guard;

so that those who were most attached to the shah, begin to shew evident signs of discontent. this has had a very strange effect upon his mind; for conceiving that he has not long to live, he has ordered a tomb to be built for himself at calaat in korisan ,457 where he was born, compos\\'d of fine marble;458 on the top of which is rais\\'d a pyramid, compos\\'d of pomgranates [sic] of gold, surmounted by a naked arm holding a sword, all of the same metal. he has appointed twelve mollas, or priests, who are to be relieved by each other thrice in 24 hours, so that four are always to be on duty, who are to hold wax candles and lamps fill\\'d with perfum\\'d oil in their hands, while they sing hymns, full of his praises.\\' 5.170 \\'constantinople, june 27. o.s. ,\\' the pennsylvania gazette (21 november, 1745): \\'thamas kouli kan (shah nadir) still remains in a state of inaction, and the seraskier459 continues to encamp with our army in the neighbourhood of erzerum. this general makes heavy complaints of the troops that have been sent to him from europe: they have committed great excesses on their march, informations of which daily arrive from all the places they have pass\\'d thro\\';

upon which there followed a very obstinate and bloody engagement. we are told here that the persians had much the worst of it; but as the court has not thought fit to publish any particulars of this pretended victory, most people take the liberty of doubting it. however that matter might be, we are assur\\'d, that immediately after the battle, the shah retir\\'d towards the city of teflis, which is the capital of georgia. some attribute this to the great loss he sustain\\'d; some to the breaking out of a rebellion in those parts; and others again, to his having receiv\\'d advice the grand signior471 was determin\\'d to act against him with all his forces. such as are reputed the best judges differ from all these, and are persuaded the shah retir\\'d for no other reason, but because the persians are not in a condition to undertake the siege of any place that is tolerably well fortified. however it has happened, the court is extremely pleased with this retreat. but we have since received some news which is not altogether so agreeable. in short, the bashaw of bassora not only persists in his rebellion,472 but has also taken the field with an army of 40,000 men; upon which it has been thought proper to form a camp of the like number of european troops in the neighbourhood of adrianople, at the head of which, it is said, the grand vizir473 will shortly put himself, in order to march against this rebel.\\' 5.174 \\'hague, oct. 15,\\' the american weekly mercury (saturday-saturday, 1-8 january, 1746) and \\'hague, october 15,\\' the boston gazette, or, weekly journal (friday, 14 january, 1746;

however, if these succeed not, many people think that the divan have more ultimatums or final resolutions at the schach\\'s service. the reason of the point being push\\'d at this conjuncture is two-fold; the one is, that the mougul army has over-run the province of caboul, and thereby put the schach under a necessity of drawing part of his forces that way, in order to stop their progress.510 this then is the critical time, as the schach must be under a necessity of moderating his demands. on the other side, that part of the divan which are in the french interest, hope, on the peace being concluded, to engage the porte in a war with the empire; or at least, by seeming to intend it, oblige the empress queen of hungary511 to draw off her forces in part, both from italy and the low countries, in order to strengthen herself on the ottoman frontiers. but it is generally thought, that nothing of all this is likely to happen;

for when the fame of his great atchievments [sic] began to spread about the world, he was by turns a native of all nations; and there did not so many cities lay claim to the honour of homer\\'s birth as there were nations contended for that of his. while he was in his infancy his father died, and left him under the care of an uncle, who by injustice, in violently defrauding his nephew of his birthright, instill\\'d into his mind, perhaps the first principles of usurpation -- his guardian\\'s unkindness obliged him to try his fortune in the army, in which he at first entered in a station that did not afford an opportunity of displaying his genius for arms to advantage: however, his great abilities, though obscured by the clouds which always overcast men in a low station, show forth a glimmering brightness enough to make him remarked by his chief commander, who sent him upon several difficult expeditions, that were the means of his acquiring great reputation; so that before he exceeded 30, the soldiers esteemed him a consummate general. this swift progress to fame and esteem were obstacles in his way to greater preferment; for though they occasioned admiration in those who were the proper rewarders of merit, they raised him up enemies in those who were his competitors for glory. these enemies prevailed, and he was obliged to give up his commission which was a general of a brigade, or the command of 1000 men. in this condition, without friends, without money, displaced by the force of faction, and cheated by one who should have been the instrument of producing him to the world with advantage; what should he do!--his mind would not let him submit to implore his uncle\\'s assistance; he disdained to ask an alms of him who subsisted in his own hereditary possession. he therefore betook himself to the mountains; and in the character of captain of about 10 banditti, which continually increased in number and in boldness, he levied contributions on all the passengers and travellers that came in his way. at length becoming so formidable and dangerous that the country was under a continual alarm from his oppressions, and the king\\'s affairs desperate, by being surrounded by his enemies on all sides, his majesty promised him a pardon if he would return from that method of life, and be reconciled with his uncle.--he accepted the pardon, and went to his uncle in seeming friendship: but before he had returned long, with the contrivance and assistance of his troops, he put an end to his uncle\\'s life, seized on his patrimony, and subdued those who were in subjection to his uncle; that is, those who were properly his own subjects, for he was hereditary governor of a certain district. the king, when he heard that thamas kuli kan had murdered his uncle and violently taken all into his possession, was very much displeased; but from the necessity of his affairs, and the want of an able commander, he was constrained to send for him, with a design to make him his general. when thamas kuli kan came to the king, his majesty reprimanded him for killing his uncle, for which thamas excused himself, by relating the cruel usage and injustice he had been treated with. the king knowing his own exigency, and the other\\'s capacity as a general, and the service he was capable of doing, forgave him, and put him in the second command of his army; from which thamas, by a masterly dissimulation, and a desire of being at the head of the army, mounted, by undermining the head commander, to be generalissimo in the year 1728. from this time he repelled the enemies of persia, and carried on his conquests with surprizing rapidity; till at last, finding his ambition still growing with his success, and incapable of controul, he deposed that prince who had actually promoted him, and set the crown of persia upon the head of a prince, who was but an infant, and the son of the deposed king. this was only his first step to take the crown upon his own head; he never intended the young king for any thing else than a piece of mock-majesty, while he governed the empire, and transacted every thing with as much arbitrariness as if he was in immediate possession of the throne. the old king was kept all this while imprisoned in a remote part of the empire, and so finished his life. after thamas had contented himselb by ruling without the kingly title for some time, he began to think the full measure of his ambition was incompleat, and having the same means in his hands that all usurpers have employ\\'d, the army on his side, which he knew was a power not to be controul\\'d by the whole persian state, he was proclaim\\'d emperor, and had the crown solemnly settled upon him and his heirs forever. thus this man rose to the sovereign dignity of persia; and though it was by indirect methods, perhaps it was with as great abilities, as ever any mortal was possessed of.--he had a readiness, and even quickness of thought beyond what is to be conceived; a memory that never forgot what was his interest to remember; whether it was a maxim or rule that could be put in practice for his profit or honour in any time of necessity, or the gratifying those who had been of eminent services to him on any occasion, or the punishing an open enemy to his government, which he always reckoned as advantage. no man ever supported a crown with more affability, without diminishing his regal pomp and dignity; yet no prince was ever more severe to those who had offended him, and would never forgive any man for a crime, that he had once determined to punish, and even had a dislike to whoever interceded for such a person. in the field, he was wise, cautious, bold, and intrepid; but his caution was never too slow, his boldness never carried him too far, nor his intrepidity into irreparable danger; for he had such a share of open ey\\'d vigilance, as served him to extricate himself upon all occasions. these qualities made him contrive justly, prosecute vigorously, and encounter danger with a courage, tempered with wariness, that would barely be distinguished from [? illegible]; and as he was always a rewarder, as well as distinguisher of merit, to his officers, always obeyed, and his soldiers loved and adored him. he was as much as any man could be, a detester of idleness, inactivity, and could not even endure it in a son. religion was not much regarded by him otherwise than it served the purpose of government, which, in his opinion, was not much; because as he had the rod in his own hand, he was resolved to drive the people which way he would; and not being dependent on any but himself for the crown, he was resolved to manage it by his own will without any external help. he loved wine, in the use of which he was moderate; but he loved women immoderately; though neither engrossed more of his time than business would permit, and that was always suited to the occasion. as to his person, it was of the largest size, of a robust make, but well proportion\\'d; his countenance comely and improved into a greater manliness by the sun and wind; his eyes black and piercing; and his voice so loud as to be heard at the distance of a hundred yards, if he exalted it a little higher than in common conversation.--what is very remarkable in this surprising person is, that whoever he admitted, of his favourites, to drink a familiar glass, he durst never shew the least freedom, or discover the least mark of having received such a favour in publick; and he observed the same exactness to them, which was a part seemingly difficult for both sides to perform with nicety. some years ago he put out the eyes of his eldest* [* some say his nephew, which is a mistake.] son542 for attempting to destroy his father to get possession of the crown; and it is tho\\'t that this has been the cause of exasperating the second to the cruel murder of his father, in order to revenge his brother\\'s loss of sight; or it may be, his not inflicting a severer punishment has proved fatal to him; for by not taking his life he left him at liberty to meditate revenge, which is likely he has effected by bringing his brother to take part in the quarrel, and stirring him to kill his father. this man, who has reign\\'d the tyrant of one of the most powerful empires in the world for twenty years and upwards, was deprived of his life by one, who was indebted to him for his being. he was, when murdered, hardly 60 years of age,543 and of such a constitution, that most people thought he might arrive at 80, with less decay of bodily constitution than is commonly perceived at 50 in other men.\\' 5.207 \\'untitled,\\' the new-york gazette, revived in the weekly post-boy (thursday, 1 february, 1748) and \\'new-york, february 1,\\' the pennsylvania journal, or weekly advertiser (9 february, 1748): \\'there are...several accounts of a revolution in persia, with the murder of the famous kouli kan, while other accounts speak of that affair in different terms, and we are at a loss what to give that may be depended on.\\' 5.208 \\'london, october 29,\\' the new-york weekly journal (wednesday, 8 february, 1748): \\'we have advice from constantinople, by the way of venice, that they were deceived in their intelligence from persia, that no insults whatsoever were offered to the turkish embassador;

and mirza ibrahim at tabreeze; and it is thought they will meet near casbin. shawrouke was born the same day and hour that nadir shah took candahar from the ophgoons45; from which circumstance he became so far his greatest favorite, that, after his india expedition, he ordered 12,000 tomands to be coined in his name, at rupees, at hyrant.\\'46 6.23 \\'moscow, july 11,\\' boston evening post (thursday, 25 september, 1749), \\'moscow, july 11,\\' the pennsylvania journal, or weekly advertiser (28 september, 1749), \\'moscow, july 11,\\' the new-york evening post (monday, 9 october, 1749) and \\'moscow, july 11,\\' the pennsylvania gazette (thursday, 12 october, 1749): \\'four factors of the english company, which was established in the kingdom of persia, are arrived here [moscow], who are returning to england to report the melancholy condition to which the affairs of that company are reduced, by having been plunder\\'d during the disturbances in that country. the damage amounts to more than four hundred thousand crowns, whereby the magazine which the company had at riatscha ,47 is entirely destroyed, and that branch of commerce utterly ruined, or at least suspended till the kingdom of persia recovers its state of tranquility.48 there continues at riatscha only two clerks, who are to stay there till an opportunity offers of recovering some part of the effects that have been pillaged. but the factors who are here, have but little hopes of their recovering any thing, because a restitution of this nature must be made by order of the sovereign;

and the young man they have set up for king, being of the old race,126 induced the people of shyrass to deliver their city into his hands without resistance; notwithstanding which, the place was instantly in the utmost confusion, and all the people carried into slavery. the credit of this acquisition has occasioned all the wild tribes in zarce or the hot countries127 to follow their fortune, more for the sake of plunder than any real design to assist them. it was imagined jaroob, doroob and iressau,128 would have made a bold stand, but they have all submitted themselves to slavery, for the lores make no difference between force or voluntary submission. lore, which is one of their chief cities, and all those parts of the kingdom, are in the utmost consternation; and as the ill treatment the english gentlemen met with at spahan, let them no room to hope for favour or mercy; both they and the dutch came to a firm resolution to leave gombroon,129 and it is not doubted but that they have done so before now, so that their grand scheme of plundering the two european factories, where they imagined half the wealth of persia was contained, will prove abortive. moshatt,130 and the carassan131 parts, are also in as bad a situation, by the daily inroads of the ophgoons,132 tartars, and other wild neighbours, having no one to protect them, for shawrooke shah is certainly blind, and destitute of money, and consequently without friends, so that the kingdom of persia is in a most deplorable condition.\\' 6.53 \\'london, june 8,\\' the new-york gazette revived in the weekly post-boy (thursday, 16 september, 1751): \\'persia is now in a more calamitous condition than ever, principally owing to the intigues [sic, intrigues] of the ottoman ministry, who have inspirited heraclius prince of georgia, to make an invasion upon that distracted empire.133 this enterprizing prince has ingratiated himself into the affection of the aghuans,134 a bold people, continually at war with the persians: with their assistance he has marched from candahar, at the head of a numerous army, into the persian provinces, where he lays all waste before him, to deprive his adversaries of assistance, and at the same time strike such a terror into the persians as may accelerate their submission to him.135 shah doub is encamped with his army in the neighbourhood of hispahan,136 where he lately defeated one of his cousins,137 who had taken up arms against him;

places himself on the throne without any of the titles which his competitors have by blood; and, though equally odious to the persians by his religion and by his usurpation, his government is so well established, that he meditates projects against the mogul\\'s207 empire. to make their story credible, they ought to have made him gain one or two victories on the road from gantcha208 to ispahan; presented us with a decisive battle before that city, or such a horrible siege as it formerly suffered,; then with the death, the flight, or the capture of schach ismael209 who was master of it. they ought to have caracterised their hero either as paving his way to the throne by a terrible massacre of the grandees, or, from a principle of clemency much more marvellous, and a dependance on the attachment of a victorious army to his person, disdaining to punish enemies whom he intended to make his subjects. in fine, they ought to have made him to abjure the christian religion, at least in appearance, or by some miracle to claim the doctors of the law and the consciences of the mahometans. the true state of the matter is as follows. the rank which heraclius holds is that of kan or governor.210 he must even be less considerable than the other kans, seeing he is not of the established religion. it is known that when the nephews and successors of schach nadir, or thomas kouli kan, were contending for the throne, the kans fell upon one another for the sake of plunder, but under pretence of serving the prince for whom they declared. all took up arms, either to attack or defend. heraclius armed in defense of georgia: and on this plan he has acted ever since. he has succeeded, and has even aggrandised himself in comparison of the other kans, who have suffered more by the ravages of civil war. his prudence and his valour do him equal honour: and as his designs were so modest, his situation was extremely favourable to them. his country being situated at the extremity of the empire, it was not exposed to the theatre of the hostilities of the rival candidates. accordingly, taking the advantage of this distance from the scene of action, he has declared for neither, always protesting, that he will obey the legal professor [sic, possessor] of the crown, that is to say, he who defeats all the rest. thus his fears in arms being proportioned to his means, were confined to the repelling the invasions of some of the neighbouring petty kans, and two nations of robbers who live one on each side of him, the aghuans settled at tauris, and the lesguis, famous highlanders of daghestan. the former, who are a kind of militia that hold of persia, being too weak to plunder the georgians with impunity, made up matters with them,211 that they might take the advantage of the present anarchy in the empire. the others, who are independent, and give themselves no trouble about the affairs of persia, fight only for slaves and cattle. it was over these that heraclius, about a year ago, gained a compleat victory, slaying 1000 of the enemy, and setting the same number of christian and turkish slaves at liberty. the fruit of this victory was the delivering guentcha,212 of which the lesguis had taken possession, and the gaining a booty of 500 tents, and the same number of mules.213 this is the last signal action which he has achieved. judge whether it was decisive for the crown of persia. you have doubtless heard that he has got possession of the ensigns of royalty. could it have been this that put it into his head to seize the kingdom? the affair was this: the assassins of schach nadir, after the commission of parricide was not to boggle at robbery: accordingly he carried off all the valuable things he could find, and among the rest the royal bonnet, sabre, &c. in the wars or thievish incursions in which he was concerned after his retreat to erivan, he had once the misfortune to be beat by the kan heraclius, into whose hands fell the ensigns of royalty, which he resolved to keep and deliver up to the rightful prince. to acquaint you in a few words who are the princes that share among them the empire of persia, or contend for it: one is chrouk-scach,214 whom one revolution deprived of his eyes and the throne, and another replaced upon it.215 he has fixed himself at mechat,216 capital of the province of chorassan, or rather of all the northern part of persia. he rules over a warlike people; but the loss of his sight and the catastrophe he has undergone, shew the weakness of his government. the other is ismael schach, who is acknowledged by all the provinces of the south, as far as the caspian sea. as he is the strongest, it is probable he will obtain the crown, if some unforeseen accident does not happen. we have lately heard of the appearance of some other princes on the scene, particularly one schach hussein, who pretends to be descended from the ancient royal house217; but his strength and the number of his adherents rather give him the air of an adventurer, than that of a candidate for such an illustrious crown.\\' 6.99 \\'constantinople, in turkey, october 1,\\' boston evening-post (monday, 8 april, 1754): \\'the three competitors for the throne of persia218 have agreed to suspend their respective quarrels \\'till they have destroyed prince heraclius, and are in full march towards him with armies of forty, thirty, and twenty six thousand men.

he has likewise taken the precautions to have concluded a treaty with the usbech tartars, and the tartars of astracan, who are to support him in his claim, and has even interested, by private means, the people under the turkish government in his favour. surprized at this unexpected m.. [?], the ottoman ministry scarcely know what steps to pursue, distressed as they are by intestine divisions, a formidable enemy on the side of egypt, in a doubtful situation respecting the russians, and now likely to be involved in a dangerous war with persia. thus situated, it will be no wonder if a peace is soon concluded with the muscovites, rather than run the risk of adding their force to the persians, which would entirely determine it against the turks, who, to avoid such consequences, will make every concession, for the present, to the russian empress,351 and use their utmost efforts to gain her assistance as a friend and ally, which, if they effect, will be the means of reducing the claims of the persians, and will leave his sublime highness at liberty to observe the peace with the empress as long as he sees proper. a body of 20,000 janissaries, and 10,000 spahis, are ordered to march immediately for adrianople, where they are to be joined by another body of ottoman troops, and from thence are to proceed to hamadan;

with many other outrages and innovations, contrary to all the treaties made for the safety and peace of the persian empire. the sophi, with the advice and consent of the divan, has resolved to join his forces with the empress of the muscovites, who is engaged in a just war against the turks. that the empress of russia shall furnish a body of 10,000 foot, and 4000 horse, with arms, ammunition, &c. and a train of artillery, immediately to assist in driving the turks from curdistan, chusistan, hamadan, and all the other places, which they now so unjustly possess in the empire of persia, and when this shall be effected to pursue the turks into the heart of their own country, even to the city of constantinople, which both muscovites and persians bind themselves under a most solemn oath to endeavour the destruction of. that the sophi of persia, in consequence of the above-mentioned assistance of the empress, shall fully yield up to the russian empire for ever all right and title to the provinces of shirvan and dagistan, together with the city of tanki,355 and all the country now in possession of the muscovites in gilan, or the ancient hyrcania, and all the contiguous coasts of the caspian sea; and that the sole right of navigating that sea shall be given up to the russians, unless they permit some persian vessels to trade thereon, for which permission they are to pay a tax to russia. in consequence of this last article her imperial majesty obliges herself to act in concert with persia, in bridling the incursions of the usbeck tartars into chorassan, or boetrea,356 the indians into candahor, and the cossacks into mazenderan. these articles being fixed and ratified, the empress is preparing with the utmost industry to put them into execution.\\' 6.164 \\'untitled,\\' the pennsylvania chronicle (monday-monday, 27 september-4 october, 1773) and \\'new-york, september 23,\\' the boston evening-post (monday, 11 october, 1773): \\'the city of bagdat was taken from the turks by the persians,357 which corroborates what was lately inserted in the papers, of an alliance between the russians and persians to destroy the turks.\\' 6.165 \\'extract of a letter from constantinople, june 26,\\' the massachusetts gazette;
